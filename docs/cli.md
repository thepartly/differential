# The `dfr` command line

Every command, every flag, and every default. The [`README.md`](../README.md) says what the
tool is for; this page is the reference behind it.

`crates/cli` is the application layer. It owns the `dfr` and `differential` binaries, and it
parses arguments and dispatches. All the work happens in
[`differential-engine`](../crates/engine/README.md). Every key in the reviewer is in
[`crates/tui/README.md`](../crates/tui/README.md).

## Install

```sh
cargo install differential
```

That installs two binaries, `dfr` and `differential`. They are the same program.

You also need:

- `git` on your PATH. All repository access shells out to real git.
- An agent CLI for the grouping stage. Five are supported, picked by name: `claude-code`
  (the default), `codex`, `droid`, `copilot` and `pi`. Each runs headless and allowed to
  read, never to write — **except `pi`, which can write**. An arbitrary command is not an
  option: the grouping call hands its agent a tool allowlist and a prompt written for what
  that agent can do. Run `dfr agents` to see what you have installed. See
  [Config](#config).

## Quick start

```sh
cd your-repo
dfr review main..feature
```

That opens the terminal reviewer. Run `dfr review` with no range and it opens a picker
instead.

To read the same plan in your IDE, in `tig`, or in plain `git log`, render it as a stack of
synthetic commits:

```sh
dfr stack main..feature
```

The first run on a range calls the LLM once. The result is cached, so a later run on the
same range does not call it again.

## The seven commands

### `dfr review [<range>]`

Open the terminal reviewer over the grouped reading plan. Two panes: the plan on the left,
the diff on the right. You mark hunks reviewed and write findings against lines. Everything
is saved as you go.

With no range it opens a picker instead of failing. See [The picker](#the-picker).

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--name <name>` | File this session under `<name>` instead of under the range. |
| `--pr [<N>]` | Review GitHub pull request `N` instead of a range: its merge-base diff, its review threads, filed under the request. Without `N`, the current branch's. Runs `gh`. |
| `--mr [<N>]` | The same for a GitLab merge request. Runs `glab`. |
| `--no-cache` | Bypass the grouping cache. This forces a fresh LLM call. |

**A request instead of a range.** `--pr` and `--mr` take no range and no `--name`: the
forge says what the endpoints are, and the request is the review's identity, so a
force-push reopens the same review. When the request's commits are not local, the tool
fetches its refs from `origin` first. Inside the reviewer the request's threads sit under their
lines, `c` on one drafts a reply, `x` resolves it and `P` publishes the open findings. See
[spec/forge.md](../spec/forge.md).

**Which review you reopen.** A review is normally filed under its base sha and the head
**as typed**, so `main..feature` stays one review while `feature` moves. A spelling with no
review of its own adopts one on the same line of history, so `main..<sha>`, `main..HEAD`
and a reopen after new commits all reach the same progress.

A rebase is the case that cannot work: it rewrites both endpoints, so neither reaches its
old self and there is nothing to adopt. Name the session and the name becomes the whole
identity — no endpoint is in the key, it works from the picker, and it survives a rebase of
either side:

```sh
# the branch name as the session name
dfr review --name "$(git branch --show-current)" main..feature
```

Use the same name to resume it, and pass it to `dfr findings` to read the same review. A
named session neither adopts nor is adopted: naming it is you saying which review this is.

### `dfr stack <range>`

Build the review commit stack and land it on a ref. Then read it in your IDE, in `tig`, or
with plain `git log`.

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--ref <name>` | The ref to land on. Default: `refs/review/<base7>-<head7>/stack`. |
| `--no-cache` | Bypass the grouping cache. |

Output:

```
refs/review/1a2b3c4-5d6e7f8/stack  (14 commits, 187 hunks, recount 187)
  decade0    31h  [focus] Introduce the storage backend trait and its implementations
  ...
review with: git log --oneline 1a2b3c4d5e6f..refs/review/1a2b3c4-5d6e7f8/stack
```

The stack never touches your worktree, your index, or your branches. It is built with git
plumbing and lands one ref. Re-running moves the ref.

<https://github.com/thepartly/differential/blob/main/crates/stack/README.md>

### `dfr check <range>`

Run the pipeline and report the structural invariants. This is the self-test and the CI
entry point. It touches no ref and no checkout. The verify stage rebuilds the head tree in
a scratch index, and on a pass every object it writes already exists (ADR 0028).

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--json` | Print a machine-readable report instead of the text one. |

### `dfr findings <range>`

Print the review's findings as JSON, re-anchored to the current plan. Use this to feed a
review into other tooling.

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--name <name>` | Read the named session, matching `dfr review --name`. |
| `--pr [<N>]` / `--mr [<N>]` | Read the request's review, as `dfr review --pr` / `--mr`. |
| `--post` | Publish the open findings to the request as review comments. Needs `--pr` or `--mr`. One line per finding: published with its URL, or skipped with the reason. |
| `--summary` | Print the open findings as markdown instead — the same text the reviewer's `y` copies, for pasting into an agent or a PR. Not with `--post`. |
| `--no-cache` | Bypass the grouping cache. |

Each record carries `{id, created, body, status, moved, plan_hash, anchor}`. The anchor
carries `{file, side, line, end_line, offset, span, hunk_digest, line_text,
end_line_text}`. `hunk_digest` keys back into the plan document's `hunks[].digest`.

### `dfr agent --doc <path>`

Print every class the grouping model may group. This is the model's read path, not a
human one: the prompt names this command, and the model runs it to read the document the
grouping stage wrote. It takes no range and no `--repo`, opens no repository and calls no
model. Diff text is `git diff`'s job.

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--doc <path>` | The document the grouping stage wrote. Required. |

### `dfr agents [--probe <name>]`

List the agents that can run the grouping call, say which are on your PATH, and mark the
ones that have been run for real. `--probe` runs one real model call against an agent and
checks four facts: it spawned, it read the prompt from stdin, it could run the fetch
command, and it was refused a write (ADR 0033). A passing probe is the evidence for
promoting an agent. Takes no range and no repository.

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--probe [<name>]` | Run one real model call against this agent, or against the configured one when no name is given. |
| `--user-config <path>` | The user config to read `[grouping].agent` from. |
| `--timeout-secs <N>` | How long to wait for a probe. Default: `300`. |

### `dfr clean [--dry-run]`

Delete the regenerable cache and report what went. Takes **no range** — the cache belongs
to the repository, not to a review.

| flag | meaning |
|---|---|
| `--dry-run` | Report what would be removed, and remove nothing. |

```
$ dfr clean --dry-run
would remove 93 grouping responses, 2 pre-group documents (1.0 MiB)
```

Two things go: the grouping responses, which cost a model call to rebuild, and the
pre-group documents, which rebuild for free. **Findings never go.** They are not cache and
they live in a sibling tree — see [Where state lives](#where-state-lives).

Clear the cache when a grouping is stale for a reason the cache key cannot see, or to
reclaim the space. A changed normaliser or language plugin does **not** need this: the key
includes the language fingerprint, so those entries go cold on their own.

## Flags every command takes

| flag | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--repo <path>` | the repo containing your cwd | Which repository to work on. |
| `--config <path>` | `<repo-root>/.differential.toml` | The repo config file. |
| `--user-config <path>` | `~/.config/differential/config.toml` | The user config file. |
| `<range>` | required for `stack`, `check` and `findings`; optional for `review` | See below. |

`dfr clean` takes only `--repo`: it reads no config and resolves no range. `dfr agent` and
`dfr agents` open no repository, so they take none of these; `dfr agents` takes
`--user-config` alone.

A path you pass explicitly must exist. A missing default file just means defaults.

## Range forms

| form | meaning |
|---|---|
| `base..head` | Two endpoints. |
| `a...b` | Base is the merge-base of `a` and `b`. This is what a merge request diff shows. |
| `<rev> <rev>` | Two revisions as two arguments. |

Only `dfr review` may omit the range. Every other command that takes one exits `2` without
it — unless `--pr` or `--mr` names a request, which stands in for the range on every
command.

## The picker

`dfr review` with no range opens a picker.

- A list of recent commits. Pick one as the **base**. Branch and tag names are shown. A
  bar marks every commit inside the range as you move.
- A checkbox, **include uncommitted changes (worktree)**, ticked by default. It appears
  only when the worktree is dirty. On a clean tree it could not change anything.

So "everything since `main`, including my uncommitted work" is one choice.

The range is `base..head`. It excludes the base commit's own changes.

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `↓` | Next commit. |
| `k` / `↑` | Previous commit. |
| `space` | Toggle "include uncommitted changes". Dirty worktree only. |
| `enter` | Use this commit as the base. Start the review. |
| `esc` / `q` | Cancel. |

## Exit codes

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Success. All invariants passed. |
| `1` | An invariant failed, or the pipeline failed. |
| `2` | A usage error or a config error. |

## Config

Two files, split by who owns the setting.

**Repo file** — `.differential.toml` at the repository root. Classification hints only.
Everyone reviewing the repo shares them.

```toml
[classify]
generated = ["**/__snapshots__/**", "migrations/**"]
not_generated = ["important.lock"]
# GitHub's convention and GitLab's, the default. Setting it REPLACES the list.
attributes = ["linguist-generated", "gitlab-generated"]
```

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `classify.generated` | `[]` | Globs that mark a file as generated. Generated files fold as noise. |
| `classify.not_generated` | `[]` | Globs that never mark a file as generated. This wins over everything. |
| `classify.attributes` | `["linguist-generated", "gitlab-generated"]` | gitattributes names read as a "generated" declaration. Setting it **replaces** the list. |

`[ordering]` and `[stack]` are reserved for later work. They are accepted and ignored. A
`[grouping]` table here is a hard error, with a hint telling you to move it.

**User file** — `~/.config/differential/config.toml`. It honours `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.

Optional. The default agent is Claude Code, headless, allowed to read the change and the
repository and nothing else. `agent` picks by name between the agents we support, not by
command line: the grouping call hands its agent a tool allowlist and a prompt written for
what that agent can do.

Five names: `claude-code` (the default), `codex`, `droid`, `copilot` and `pi`. Four of them
are stopped from writing by an allowlist, an OS sandbox or their own default. **`pi` is
not** — it ships no sandbox and no per-command allowlist, and the shell tool it needs to
read your diff is the one that lets it write (ADR 0033).

`claude-code`, `codex` and `pi` have been run against the real CLI and pass.
**`droid` and `copilot` have not**, and two of the three that were checked needed a fix
first, so expect these to need one too. `dfr agents` marks them, and
`dfr agents --probe <name>` is how one stops being marked.

```toml
[grouping]
agent = "claude-code"   # or codex, droid, copilot, pi
timeout_secs = 1200

[review]
theme = "dark"
context = 3
context_step = 10
# Diff layout a review opens in: "split" or "unified".
diff = "split"

[keys]
next-group = ["ctrl-j"]
delete = ["d d"]   # a sequence is written with spaces
publish = []       # unbound
```

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `grouping.agent` | `claude-code` | Which agent runs the grouping call, by name. One of `claude-code`, `codex`, `droid`, `copilot`, `pi`. |
| `grouping.timeout_secs` | `1200` | How long to wait for the backend. |
| `review.context` | `3` | Context lines shown around a hunk before any expansion. |
| `review.context_step` | `10` | Lines one `z` pulls in at a context boundary row. |
| `review.diff` | `split` | Layout a review OPENS in. `s` still toggles, and a review that has recorded a choice keeps it. |
| `review.theme` | `dark` | Which palette the reviewer wears, by name. See below. |
| `keys.<action>` | the reviewer's own keys | The keys an action answers to. Setting it **replaces** that action's defaults, and `[]` unbinds it. The names, and the keys that cannot be rebound, are in [`spec/tui.md`](../spec/tui.md#rebinding). |

Resolution order for each file: the explicit flag, then the default path, then the built-in
defaults. A missing file means defaults. A malformed file is a hard error. An unknown key
is a hard error too.

The reviewer can also edit and save this file: `:config` in `dfr review` opens a modal
over every key above ([`spec/tui.md`](../spec/tui.md#config-modal)). **Saving from there
rewrites the file whole, so its comments and layout are not kept.** Every `[review]` value
is written out, defaults included.

A `[keys]` table is checked before `dfr review` opens the terminal. An unknown action, a
string that is not a key, `ctrl-c` (it quits from everywhere), and two actions on one key in
one screen are each a usage error, exit 2. The error lists every problem in the table:

```
error: config error in ~/.config/differential/config.toml: [keys]: 2 problems
  "j" is bound to both down and delete in the review
  "j" is bound to both down and delete in the findings list
```

### Themes

`review.theme` names one of eleven palettes. Each pairs a set of chrome colours with the
syntax theme the code is painted in, so the diff and the code come from one source.

`dark` (the default), `one-dark`, `one-light`, `gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light`,
`solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `catppuccin-latte`,
`dracula`, `monokai`.

The shots below are the same change in the same reviewer, so what differs between them is
only the palette. Regenerate with `./assets/themes.sh`.

An unknown name is a hard error that lists the valid ones. `theme` in the **repo** file is
rejected: a palette is the reader's choice, not the repository's.

A theme is a *derived* palette, not a copy of a published one. Each declares a syntax theme
and six accents — an addition, a deletion, the accent, the skim tier, the highlight, a
finding — and the remaining thirty-odd colours are mixed from those against the ground the
syntax theme itself declares (ADR 0024). Where a published palette's own accents were not
legible as interface text, they were adjusted and the reason recorded in that theme's file
under `crates/tui/src/theme/`.

**Config never removes a file or a hunk from analysis.** It tunes classification hints and
tool behaviour only.

The backend's identity is part of the grouping cache key. So two people running different
agents get separate cache entries. That is correct: a different model may group
differently.

## Where state lives

Everything lives under the repository's git common directory. Nothing is written to your
worktree.

```
<git-common-dir>/differential/
├── reviews/<review-id>/
│   ├── plans/<content-hash>.json   every generated document, immutable
│   ├── current                     the active plan's content hash
│   ├── findings.jsonl              the findings store; the forge never writes here
│   ├── comments.jsonl              a cache of the request's review threads
│   ├── identity.json               a name, or the endpoints it was opened as
│   └── state.json                  progress and view preferences
├── reviews/<review-id>/
│   └── alias                       a redirect: read that review instead
└── cache/
    ├── grouping/<classes-hash>.json   the raw model response
    └── document/<content-hash>.json   the pre-group document
```

`cache/` and `reviews/` are siblings on purpose. Everything under `cache/` can be
recomputed; findings cannot. `dfr clean` removes `cache/` and nothing else, so it has no
path by which to reach your findings.

The review id derives from the resolved base sha plus the head **as typed**. So reviewing
`main..feature` keeps one review while `feature` moves.
