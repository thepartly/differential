# Architecture

How `differential` turns a large diff into a reading plan, and why it is built this way.

The normative behaviour lives in [`spec/`](../spec/). The decision records, with their
evidence, live in [`adr/`](../adr/). This page explains how the pieces fit together.

## The problem

Most of a large merge request is one decision repeated. A signature change reaches every
call site. A rename reaches every import. A lockfile is regenerated whole.

The changes that need careful reading are a small part of it. The rest has to be skippable
without the reviewer guessing which part is which.

## Coverage and judgement

Coverage is structural. Judgement is delegated.

### 1. Mechanical partition

Every hunk gets a **shape class**. Two hunks in one class are textually identical after
normalisation.

A shape class is normalised text, hashed: four regex substitutions over the raw bytes of the
diff.

Regex rather than a parser, and for one reason. Enumeration is total, so **every** hunk in
every file needs a class — a lockfile, a manifest, a translation catalogue, a language
nobody has written a grammar for. A parser can only classify what it can parse. Freezing
the normaliser follows from the same place: changing it moves every class population at
once (ADR 0015).

The tool does parse elsewhere. The dependency graph behind *Deterministic ordering*, below,
reads whole files with tree-sitter and declines the files it cannot read. It can afford to.
A missing edge misorders; a missing class would hide a hunk.

The generic normaliser is
[`crates/engine/src/lang/generic.rs`](../crates/engine/src/lang/generic.rs), in
`normalize_line`. It does exactly this, in this order:

| step | rule |
|---|---|
| 1 | Strings become `"S"`. |
| 2 | Numbers become `N`. |
| 3 | Identifiers of four characters or more become `I`. |
| 4 | Runs of whitespace collapse to one space, then the line is trimmed. |

So this hunk:

```diff
-    let timeout = Duration::from_secs(30);
+    let timeout = Duration::from_secs(config.timeout);
```

normalises to:

```
- let I = I::I(N);
+ let I = I::I(I.I);
```

`let` survives because it is three characters, below the identifier threshold. Any other
hunk that reduces to those same two lines is the same shape.

The framing around the normaliser is
[`crates/engine/src/shape.rs`](../crates/engine/src/shape.rs), in `shape_hash`. It prefixes
each removed line with `-` and each added line with `+`, **sorts each side**, joins them
with newlines, appends the file's disposition letter, takes a sha1, and keeps the first 12
hex characters. That string is the class key.

Two details in there carry weight. Both sides are hashed, not just the added side — hashing
added lines alone collapses every deletion-only hunk into one class, which would make
"same shapes, skippable" false (ADR 0004). And the disposition is part of the key, so a
whole-file addition and a modification with identical text are different shapes.

Sorting each side means a hunk is compared as a multiset of lines rather than a sequence.
The framing is inherited unchanged from the validated prototype.

`normalize_line` is pluggable per language ([ADR 0015](../adr/0015-language-abstraction.md)).
The framing is not. The generic normaliser is frozen against the validated prototype so
class populations stay comparable with its recorded outputs; improvements land as language
plugins with their own ids.

Coverage is 100% by construction. No model is involved. No file is excluded.

### 2. An LLM merges and labels class ids, never hunks

Asking a model to partition hunks directly fails silently. We measured it. On large
refactors, coverage dropped as low as 27% while the model reported success. An omitted hunk
index is indistinguishable from one that never existed.

Here the model can only group **class ids**. Anything it omits is detected against the known
id set and back-filled into a must-read group.

The model contributes what hashing cannot: merging twenty textually different shape classes
into one "path and import swaps" group. See
[ADR 0001](../adr/0001-llm-merges-class-ids-never-hunks.md).

The model is not handed a description of the change. The engine writes the pre-group
document and the prompt says where it is; the model then fetches what it needs with
`dfr agent`. So it can read every member of a class before claiming they are the same edit,
and nothing is dropped to fit a prompt. See
[ADR 0022](../adr/0022-the-model-fetches-its-own-context.md).

### 3. Deterministic ordering

Edges run from a symbol's definition to its uses, between **classes**, computed before the
model runs. The focus section is sorted foundation-first by contracting those edges onto
groups, so a definition is ordered before its references. Every edge names the symbol that
produced it, and a cycle says whether it is in the change or only in the grouping.

The symbols come from a reader, and which reader is decided per file. A tuned tree-sitter
query handles Rust, TypeScript, Python, Go, Kotlin, Java and C#; generic field rules handle
JavaScript, C and C++; a regex handles anything else that looks like source. **A
file no reader claims — a lockfile, a manifest, a README — contributes nothing**, because a
guess costs more than silence.

What counts as a definition is the part that matters. It is a file-scope name others can
use: not `mod template;`, which names a module, and not a method inside a type, which is
reached through that type. Counting those turned common words into globally unique symbols,
and six of them once produced 64% of a real range's edges. See
[spec/ordering.md](../spec/ordering.md) and
[`adr/0023-symbol-extraction-is-a-domain-port.md`](../adr/0023-symbol-extraction-is-a-domain-port.md).

### 4. Structural audits

Two halves, split at the write boundary (ADR 0028).

- Every changed file must reconstruct **byte-exactly** from its base plus its hunks. This
  one only reads, and it runs inside the pipeline, before any document is emitted, beside
  the enumeration and accounting checks.
- The final tree is rebuilt **from applied hunks**, never copied, and must equal the real
  head tree.
- An independent, deliberately dumb recount over git's own output must match.

The last two build a tree, so they write, and they run in the separate `verify` stage:
`dfr check` and `dfr stack` run it, the reviewer does not. Each audit caught a real bug
during validation. See [`spec/invariants.md`](../spec/invariants.md).

### Read and skipped hunks

Skim exemplars still get read. So documents track **read hunks** and **skipped hunks**
separately. Only the second number is time saved.

## The pipeline

`enumerate → classify → group → order`, then an optional `verify`. The document records
which stages ran, in `generator.stages`. See [spec/overview.md](../spec/overview.md).

The pipeline is **read-only**: its bound list carries no write port, so it cannot write.
Invariants 1b, 1 and 2 run inside it and gate the document. Invariants 3 and 4 build a tree,
so they write, and they live in `verify` — which `dfr check` and `dfr stack` run, and the
reviewer does not (ADR 0028).

The product is **one JSON document** ([spec/json-contract.md](../spec/json-contract.md)).
Renderers are views over it:

- **Shadow branch** ([spec/stack.md](../spec/stack.md)) — the diff rewritten as a synthetic
  commit stack. `git log --oneline` over it is the reading plan. Shipped, as `dfr stack`.
- **TUI** ([spec/tui.md](../spec/tui.md)) — a reviewer that emits structured
  findings keyed by hunk. Shipped, as `dfr review`. `dfr findings` prints those findings as
  JSON.
- **Forge review** ([spec/forge.md](../spec/forge.md)) — a pull request's or merge request's
  review threads shown under their lines, and findings published back as review comments.
  Shipped, as `dfr review --pr` / `--mr` and `dfr findings --post`, through `gh` and `glab`
  on the path (ADR 0029).

## Guarantees

**No file is excluded from enumeration.** No extension filters. No path exclusions. Not
even through config. Manifest and lockfile edits are where repeated edits appear, and
path filtering was the single worst coverage bug found during validation (ADR 0005, 0012).
Config, language plugins and symbol readers tune *classification*, never *what exists*.

A reader declining a file is classification, not exclusion. A README contributes no symbols,
so it draws no dependency edges — and its file, its hunks and its classes are all still
there, still counted, still read.

**A low-similarity rename is not treated as a verbatim move.** Renames carry git's
similarity score on both halves. Below 95, the change is a modification and is never
skim-eligible. A deterministic gate enforces this after the model runs (ADR 0003).

**Groupings are pinned.** Labels are not deterministic across model calls. A content-hash
cache keeps a review from reshuffling under the reviewer (ADR 0009).

**Documents are pure functions of `base..head`.** Review state — findings and progress —
lives in a sidecar store. It re-anchors across regenerations by exact hunk digest. An
orphan is listed, never silently dropped. See
[spec/persistence.md](../spec/persistence.md).

## Crate layout

| crate | what it holds |
|---|---|
| [`crates/engine`](../crates/engine/README.md) | The backend: git io, diff parsing, the byte-exact applier, shape classes, grouping, ordering, invariants and review sessions. Owns the ports, including the symbol one; implements none of the readers. |
| [`crates/symbols`](../crates/symbols) | The symbol readers: tree-sitter with tuned queries, tree-sitter with generic field rules, and a regex floor. Depends on the engine, never the reverse. |
| [`crates/stack`](../crates/stack/README.md) | The shadow-branch renderer. The diff as a synthetic commit stack. |
| [`crates/tui`](../crates/tui/README.md) | The terminal reviewer. Vendored `tuicr` and `lumen` pieces live here. |
| [`crates/cli`](cli.md) | The application layer: the `dfr` and `differential` binaries. Argument parsing and dispatch only. |
| `crates/testutil` | Shared test fixtures. `publish = false`. |

Inside the engine, four module boundaries carry weight:

| module | what it is |
|---|---|
| `engine::schema` | The frozen JSON contract. Serde types only, no engine internals. |
| `engine::plan` | Shared domain policy over the schema. Both renderers read tiers and reading splits from here, so they cannot disagree. |
| `engine::ports` | The traits the domain owns. |
| `engine::store` and `engine::gitio` | The adapters that implement those ports. |

Dependency direction is strict: `cli → {tui, stack} → engine`.

`engine::schema` stays the product boundary. It is a reviewed module discipline rather than
a crate boundary (ADR 0008, 0018).

All git access shells out to real git, plumbing commands only. The byte-exactness guarantees
were validated against real git output and nothing else (ADR 0002, 0011).

Domain code reaches git through `engine::ports`, and `gitio::Repo` is their only
implementation. `Repo::run` is private, so a function's trait bounds are an accurate
statement of how much git it can touch. A fake git would make invariants 1 to 4 compare a fake with
itself, so it is impossible to introduce by accident (ADR 0020, enforced by
`engine/tests/layering.rs`).

## Testing

**Unit tests cover the byte-level traps.** No-trailing-newline permutations worth exactly
one byte. Deleted lines starting with `--`. CRLF round-trips.

**Integration tests run the full pipeline** against hermetic temporary repositories, for
every edge case: modes, symlinks, binary files, submodules, typechanges, and renames at
high and low similarity.

**Grouping and stack tests drive a programmable fake LLM backend.** The LLM is the one seam
where a fake is correct: it is chosen at run time.

**A parity test asserts exact class-count agreement** with the validated prototype, on a
real private corpus. It runs from an environment variable, so it is local-only. Drift is a
port bug. It is never tolerated by adjusting the number.
