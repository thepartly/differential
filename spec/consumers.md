# Consuming the engine

The core is a **library** (ADR 0014, 0018). Consumers — the TUI (`differential-tui`), the
shadow-branch builder (`differential-stack`), the forge poster — link `differential-engine`
directly (the frozen contract lives in `engine::schema`); the JSON form of the document is
for export and persistence, not inter-process plumbing. The binaries (`dfr`, also installed
as `differential`) live in the application-layer `crates/cli`, which consumes the renderer
crates.

## The renderer binary

```sh
dfr review [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--name <s>] [--no-cache] <range>
dfr review [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--no-cache] --pr [N] | --mr [N]
dfr stack [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--ref <name>] [--no-cache] <range>
dfr findings [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--name <s>] [--summary] [--no-cache] <range>
dfr findings [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--summary | --post] [--no-cache] --pr [N] | --mr [N]
dfr check [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--json] <range>
dfr agent --doc <path>
dfr agents [--probe [<name>]] [--user-config <path>] [--timeout-secs <N>]
dfr clean [--repo <path>] [--dry-run]
```

- `review` opens the terminal reviewer ([tui.md](tui.md)); `findings` prints the review's
  findings as re-anchored JSON, or as markdown with `--summary` — the open ones as
  `- file:lines: note`, which is the same text the reviewer's `y` copies. Both come from
  `ReviewSession`, so the projection has one owner and the two cannot drift.
- `--pr [N]` replaces the range with a GitHub pull request's merge-base diff and files the
  review under the request itself ([forge.md](forge.md)); `--mr [N]` does the same for a
  GitLab merge request. Either stands in for the range on every command above, `check` and
  `stack` included. When the request's commits are not local, the tool fetches its refs
  from `origin` first. `findings --post` publishes the open findings to it. `--pr` runs
  `gh`, `--mr` runs `glab`.
- `clean` deletes the regenerable cache ([persistence.md](persistence.md)) and reports
  what went. It takes no range — the cache belongs to the repository, not to a review —
  and it never touches findings, which live in a sibling tree.
- `stack` builds and lands the review commit stack ([stack.md](stack.md)), printing the
  commit list and the `git log` line to review with. The grouping backend comes from
  `[grouping].agent` (default: `claude-code`; five names, four with read-only tools and
  `pi` without — ADR 0033); the pinning cache
  lives under `<git-common-dir>/differential/cache/grouping` unless `--no-cache`. The
  document the model reads sits beside it, under `…/cache/document`.
- `check` runs the core pipeline and reports invariants 1–4 — the self-test and CI entry
  point.
- `agent` is the grouping model's read path (ADR 0022), not a human one, and it is the
  whole of that path: one command, one answer, no sub-questions. It prints every class the
  model may group, in full — id, hunk count, file count, disposition, exemplar location,
  then every member hunk with its file and line range, then every file, with `defines:`,
  `uses:` and `used by:` lines. That is 72KB for a 196-class change, beside
  the 322KB of diff the model reads anyway, so slicing it into four queries bought three
  extra model turns and nothing else. The prompt names the running executable, and the
  default backend's allowlist is derived from the same string, so the two cannot disagree
  about what the model may invoke. Generated content is left out, as the prompt's id list
  leaves it out. It takes no `--repo`: every answer comes from the document, diff text is
  `git diff`'s job, and so it opens no repository, never runs the pipeline and never calls
  a model — a grouping run cannot recurse into itself. An empty change prints a plain
  sentence and exits 0 — to an agent a blank reply reads as "the tool is broken".
- `agents` lists the agents that can run the grouping call, says which are on `PATH` and
  marks the ones that have been run for real; `--probe` runs one real model call against
  an agent, or the configured one, and checks that it spawned, read the prompt from stdin,
  could run the fetch command and was refused a write (ADR 0033). It takes no range and
  no repository: which agent you run is a per-user choice.
- Exit codes: 0 success/all pass, 1 invariant or pipeline failure, 2 usage/config error.

## Library surface

```rust
use differential_engine::{gitio::Repo, config::Config, lang::LanguageRegistry,
                          store::OsConfigSource, resolve_range, run_pipeline};

let repo = Repo::open(path)?;                       // any dir inside the repo
let config = Config::load(&OsConfigSource, repo.root(), None, None)?; // or defaults
let src = resolve_range(&repo, &["main..feature"])?;   // a ReviewSource
let out = run_pipeline(&repo, &src, &config,
                       &LanguageRegistry::builtin(),
                       &differential_symbols::readers())?;   // the symbol readers
// out.report: InvariantReport — always present
// out.document: Option<PlanDocument> — None iff an invariant failed
```

- `resolve_range` accepts `a..b`, `a...b` (base = merge-base — what an MR/PR diff is), or
  two revs, and returns a `plan::ReviewSource`: the endpoints (`base`, `head`, `kind`) plus
  the review's **identity** (`head_spec`, the head as typed, and `identity_base`). The two
  are separate because reviewing uncommitted work diffs against synthesized trees that churn
  on every edit while the review itself must survive (ADR 0017). `resolve_picked` builds the
  same type from the picker's answer.
- `review_identity::resolve(catalogue, git, &ReviewIdentity)` says which review directory an
  identity opens. `ReviewIdentity::Range { base, head_spec }` is filed under its endpoints:
  the spelling is part of a review's name, so a spelling with no review of its own adopts one
  on the same base whose head is reachable from this one, and the join is recorded (ADR
  0026). `ReviewIdentity::Named(name)` keys on the name alone — no endpoint, no scan, no git
  call, and no adoption in either direction (ADR 0027). Call it before
  `store::FsReviewStore::for_review`, which takes the id rather than deriving one —
  otherwise a consumer and the reviewer can end up in two reviews of one range.
- `run_pipeline` runs all invariants before emitting anything; on a violation there is no
  document, only the report saying what failed.
- `run_grouped_pipeline(…, &GroupingOptions { backend, cache, artefacts, fetch, progress })`
  additionally runs the grouping stage ([grouping.md](grouping.md)). `artefacts` is where
  the pre-group document is left for the model to read (`store::FsArtefactStore`); like the
  cache, disabling it is a state of the store, not an `Option`. `fetch` is the executable
  the model runs to read that document — normally this process — and the backend's tool
  allowlist must be built from the same string, or the prompt names a command the model
  may not run. All are **injected**: the engine
  no longer builds a backend from `[grouping].agent` — composition is the application
  layer's job (ADR 0020) — and disabling the cache is
  `store::FsGroupingCache::disabled()` rather than an absent one, so the stage never grows
  a branch for `--no-cache`. Cancellation belongs to the backend
  (`CommandBackend::with_cancel`), since the thing that needs killing is the subprocess.
- Language plugins (ADR 0015), symbol readers (`engine::artefact::symbols`, ADR 0023) and
  LLM backends (`engine::llm`, ADR 0016/0018) are injected by the consumer;
  `LanguageRegistry::builtin()`, `differential_symbols::readers()` and
  `CommandBackend::claude_cli()` are the defaults (`codex_cli`, `droid_cli`, `copilot_cli`
  and `pi_cli` are the other four). A consumer that wires no readers gets a
  document with no dependency edges, so nothing is ordered foundation-first.

## Dev entry point

One example remains for debugging the grouped document itself (JSON to stdout):

```sh
cargo run -p differential-symbols --example group -- [--repo <path>] [--config <path>] [--no-cache] [-o <file>] <base>..<head>
```

## Config: two files, split by ownership

**Repo-level** — `.differential.toml` at the target repo's root. Classification hints
only: shared by everyone reviewing the repo. Resolution: `--config` path >
`<repo-root>/.differential.toml` > built-in defaults.

```toml
[classify]
# Additive globs marking files as generated (noise-tier hint).
generated = ["**/__snapshots__/**", "migrations/**"]
# Overrides: never mark these generated, wins over builtins/attributes/globs.
not_generated = ["important.lock"]
# gitattributes attribute names honoured as "generated" declarations. Shown at
# their default: GitHub's convention and GitLab's, because a repository does not
# choose its forge to suit this tool. Setting the key REPLACES the list.
attributes = ["linguist-generated", "gitlab-generated"]
```

**User-level** — `~/.config/differential/config.toml` (honours `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`).
The agent backend: a per-user choice, never a repo setting — not everyone uses the same
agent. Resolution: `--user-config` path > the XDG location > built-in default.
A `[grouping]` table in the REPO file is a hard error with a migration hint.

```toml
[grouping]
# Which agent runs the grouping call. Five names: "claude-code" (the default),
# "codex", "droid", "copilot", "pi" — each a headless invocation this crate
# builds whole (ADR 0033). Four are allowed to read the change and the
# repository and nothing else; "pi" can also write, because it ships no
# sandbox and no per-command allowlist. A name nobody implements is a hard
# error that says which ones exist.
agent = "claude-code"
# How long to wait for it. Default 1200s. This one is a number because it tunes
# the agent rather than replacing it.
timeout_secs = 1200
```

`[review]` is the reviewer's own presentation, and per-user for the same reason: how a
screen looks is the reader's business, not the repository's. A `[review]` table in the REPO
file is rejected — nothing enforces that by hand, the repo file simply has no such field
and denies unknown ones.

```toml
[review]
# Which palette the reviewer wears. One of: dark (the default), one-dark,
# one-light, gruvbox-dark, gruvbox-light, solarized-dark, solarized-light,
# catppuccin-mocha, catppuccin-latte, dracula, monokai. A name nobody
# implements is a hard error that says which ones exist.
theme = "dark"
# Context lines shown either side of a hunk before any expansion.
context = 3
# Lines one `z` at a context boundary row pulls in.
context_step = 10
# Diff layout a review opens in: "split" (the default) or "unified". A default,
# not a setting: `s` still toggles, and a review that has recorded a choice
# keeps it.
diff = "split"
```

`theme` is a **name, not a colour list**, for the same reason `agent` is a name and not an
argv. A palette is not a value the caller supplies but a coherent set the renderer builds:
thirty-odd colours plus the syntax theme the code is painted in, all derived together so
the chrome and the code cannot disagree (ADR 0024). A free-form colour table would be a
knob that looked like it worked, and would freeze thirty field names as public API.
Adding a theme is adding a `config::ThemeName` variant and a seed file.

`agent` is a **name, not an argv**, and that is the whole point. The grouping stage does
not merely spawn a process: it hands the agent a tool allowlist, a fetch command and a
prompt written for what that agent can do (ADR 0022). An arbitrary argv got the prompt and
none of the rest, so it was a knob that looked like it worked. Adding an agent is adding a
`config::Agent` variant and the arm in `backend_from` the compiler then demands.

Because the backend's **identity** is part of the grouping cache key, users running
different agents get separate cache entries in the clone's shared cache — correct, since a
different model may group differently. Identity is not the command as it runs: the default
backend's argv names the executable the prompt tells the model to fetch with, and where
that binary lives determines nothing, so it is held out of the key
(`LlmBackend::identity`). A cache therefore survives a rebuild, a reinstall and a second
checkout, which is what `plan::grouping_cache_dir` promises by living under the git common
directory.

A missing file means defaults; a malformed file is a hard error, never silently ignored.
**The one hard rule: config can never remove a file or hunk from enumeration.**
Enumeration is total, always — every invariant depends on it (ADR 0012). Config tunes
classification hints and tool behaviour only.

Sections reserved for later milestones (documented so the file format is stable):
`[ordering]`, `[stack]` (ref namespace) in the repo file.
