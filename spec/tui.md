# The review TUI (`dfr review`)

A dedicated reviewer over the grouped, ordered document. Two panes: the reading plan and
the diff for the selected entry.

**Geometry is model state.** The event loop measures the terminal and pushes it into the
model before any key is handled, so scrolling is arithmetic over a known height and drawing
is a pure function of the model. A resize is folded in like any other event, in stream
order — keys before and after it each see the geometry that was true when they were
pressed. Row *contents* still compose their columns at draw time from the pane width, which
is why a resize never rebuilds rows.

The panes are a fixed split and **focus never changes a height**: the overviews below float
over a pane rather than taking room from one, which is what keeps the heights a function of
the terminal alone.

**A wrapped line is still one row.** `w` soft-wraps the detail pane, and a line that takes
three screen lines is one selectable row throughout: the cursor indexes rows, a finding
anchors to a line, and a line split into three rows would let a reader annotate a third of
it. What that costs is the scroll offset, which stops being a count of rows and becomes a
budget of screen lines — the view walks cumulative row heights, so a wrapped row is never
cut at its top. A row taller than the whole pane therefore pins to the top and loses its
tail. Every continuation line repeats the row's leading indent, and a finding's rail with
it, so a wrapped note stays inside its quoted panel. The line-number cell on a continuation
is blank and the same width, per the rule that the cell never changes width.

**Prose wraps whether `w` is on or not** — a group's description, its `depends on:` line
and a reviewer's note. They are never code, they are the reason the plan and the finding
exist, and a reader who cannot see the end of one is missing the point of the pane.
Wrapping FILE CONTENT is the reader's call, because wrapping code is often unwanted;
`w` is persisted per review, as `s` is.

**Keys act on the pane you are in.** `z` shows what is being withheld — a context
boundary's hidden lines, a folded remainder, a directory — and which of those it means is
decided by the focused pane, not by where the diff's cursor happens to be parked. The
cursor is a diff row wherever the focus is, so without that rule a press in the file tree
opened part of a file the reader was not looking at.

**One key for files, acting on the pane it is pressed in.** In the left pane `f` chooses
which list of files you are reading — the plan or the tree. In the diff pane it chooses
which file you are looking at. It used to be two keys, and the one that switched the left
pane worked from either side, so a press in the diff pane silently rearranged the pane
behind it.

**Reading plan.** Groups in rank order, each a small block: the group **id**, effort tier
and label, then file count with added/removed line totals (in their own colours), the
role — as a pill against the pane's **right edge**, in the same muted colours a hunk's
title pill wears, since it is a fact about the group rather than a decoration on it, and
the **same** pill the group's header carries in the detail pane. Right-aligned so the roles
read as a column: trailing the counts, each began wherever those happened to end, which
makes a word you can only read by finding it first. Then `after: <ids>` naming the groups
it follows — the id column is what makes those
references resolvable.

The trailing **back-filled** group — classes the model omitted, recovered by the coverage
audit (ADR 0001, invariant 5) — is labelled `[unclassified]` with a `?` tier glyph rather
than `[focus]`/`F`. It is must-read either way, but for a different reason: nothing
judged it. The shadow-branch renderer has always said so on its commit subject, and the
two renderers read the flag from the same projection so they cannot disagree.

The plan is a **graph, not a tree**: a group can follow several others, and it is not
acyclic — it can contain cycles (two groups that each define symbols the other uses). The ordering
stage breaks a cycle deterministically, which means some edge cannot be honoured; the
plan says so rather than hiding it — a dependency listed **later** than the group that
follows it is visible in the connector, which runs **down** from the selected group rather
than up. The `after:` line does not mark it: every id there reads the same, since a warning
on a row is worth its weight only when the reader can do something about it. Selecting a group draws a connector in the left gutter linking
it (`◆`) to every group it **follows**, so what has to be read first is visible without
reading ids. One direction only: the reverse edge is deliberately not drawn, so the gutter
says the same thing as the `after:` line beneath it rather than something different. Each
tick wears the **same arm** the file tree's guides wear (`├─`, `└─`, and `◆─` at the
selected group), in the pane's own border grey, so it reaches the title it points at: two guides a pane apart had no
reason to draw the same relation differently, and a tick that stopped a cell short read as
a mark floating beside the row rather than as a line into it. Counts derive from hunks, so binary/submodule
changes contribute zero and a rename counts as two files (the canonical view is
`--no-renames`). Skim groups show one exemplar per shape class with the remainder folded
behind a single line; noise groups are folded entirely.

**File view.** `f`, in the left pane, switches it to a **tree** of every file in the document
(including binary/submodule changes the group view cannot surface). Directories nest,
show their aggregate counts, and fold with `z`/`enter`; selecting a directory shows every
hunk beneath it, selecting a file shows that file's hunks in position order regardless of
grouping, each hunk header carrying its group's label. Reviewed marks are shared between
the views — they key on hunk content either way.

**Focus floats a map of the other pane.** Each side keeps its own job; what changes is what
is laid over it, so an unfocused pane earns its space without either pane losing any.

Reading the **plan**, the document's file tree floats over the detail pane with the selected
group's files lit — `files in g0 · 3 of 8` — so what a group spans is one look rather than a
walk through its hunks. It sits at the **foot of the detail pane** at full pane width, the
same shape the file list takes at the foot of the plan pane, so one focus reads like the
other. Its height is **capped against the group's header block**, leaving the full label
and description readable where the 40-column plan pane truncates them, and the diff carries
on above it as a preview of what entering the group will show. **A pane too short for both
the header block and a box yields the box**: the map lifts entirely rather than land on the
label the cap exists to protect. The tree is drawn with
connector guides and marks a lit file beside its name rather than out in a column of its
own. Deliberately not interactive: it is a map, and a second cursor in a second pane is a
thing to explain and to get wrong.

**The map folds on the group.** A document of any size otherwise runs past the bottom of
the float. A directory the group never enters is **one row** with a `▸` and the number of
files under it, and a chain of such directories is joined into that row (`▸ a/b/c/`), so a
deep path the reader is not going into costs one line rather than four. Inside a directory
the group does enter, the files it does not touch fold to a count (`… 6 more`). What
remains is exactly the group's own files, each lit, in the tree that holds them — which is
the question the float is asked. The fold is the map's own: it never touches the file
view's folds, whose state belongs to the reader's `z` and to that pane's cursor.

Reading the **detail**, a flat list of the files in view floats over the foot of the plan
pane, the current one lit edge to edge and the title counting `file 2 of 7`. Lit, not
marked with a glyph: the row the reader is on is the one place they are already looking,
and a marker column costs every other row two cells to say nothing.

Neither float appears in the **file view**, where the left pane is already a file tree: a
map of one group would name a group nothing is selecting, and a file list would be the pane
behind it. Both trees are drawn with the same connector guides.

**A file header sticks.** It is the path and nothing else — no leading glyph, since the
one bar in this column belongs to a hunk's edge and a second one a row above it said
nothing the bold cyan path had not already said. Scrolled past it, the filename pins to
the pane's top row, which costs a row only while it would otherwise be invisible. The hunk pill does not stick with
it: two pinned rows is most of a small pane, and the pill's information is in the plan pane
anyway.

**Diff pane.** Unified layout by default, `s` toggles a side-by-side split (the layout
choice persists per review); syntax highlighting and word-level change emphasis.

**The pane also moves sideways.** `h` and `l` shift the file content eight columns at a
time and `0` returns it to the left edge. A line wider than the pane is cut with an
ellipsis, and in split the column is half a pane, so it happens twice as often there —
`w` was the only way to reach the end of one, and wrapping code is often unwanted. Only
**file content** moves: a hunk header, a context boundary, a fold, a finding and a group
header are chrome and prose, already fitted to the pane, and a `╱` band slid sideways says
nothing. The **line-number cell never moves**, because it is what the cursor's block lands
in. In split **both halves shift together**, from their own left edges, or the two columns
stop being comparable, which is the reason to read a diff side by side at all.

`w` and the shift answer the same question and only one of them can be right at a time, in
both directions. A wrapped pane refuses `h` and `l` and says why rather than doing nothing:
a press that changes nothing reads as a key that does not work. Turning `w` **on** drops the
shift rather than remembering it — a wrapped row reads no offset, so an offset left behind
is one nothing on screen can act on, and the footer would go on naming a shift that is not
happening. The shift stops at the widest line's
overflow, so the pane can never be walked into blank space. It is **transient**, like an
open fold and a hunk's expansion — where along a line a reader is looking is a reading
position for this sitting, not a preference, so nothing about it reaches the sidecar.

**The palette is chosen, and painted.** `[review].theme` in the user config names one of
eleven: `dark` (the default), `one-dark`, `one-light`, `gruvbox-dark`, `gruvbox-light`,
`solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`, `catppuccin-mocha`, `catppuccin-latte`, `dracula`,
`monokai`. Each pairs the reviewer's colours with the syntax theme the code is painted in,
and derives the former from the latter's own ground, so the chrome and the code are one
palette rather than two that drift (ADR 0024).

A theme paints its **own background**. The terminal's used to show through wherever nothing
else painted, which is most of the screen — and is why the reviewer could only ever be
dark. It follows that every float clears to the theme's ground rather than to the
terminal's: a `Clear` that is not repainted punches a hole of the wrong colour, which is
invisible on a dark terminal and glaring on a light palette.

Nothing about the palette is a run-time toggle. It is read once at startup and threaded
from there — rows bake their colours in when they are built, not when they are drawn, so a
palette is an input to building a row rather than something drawing consults.

**Colour carries the change.** There are no `-`/`+` marker columns: a changed line's
background runs to the pane edge, and its line-number cell is a stronger block of the same
colour, which is what makes the gutter read as an edge. In split mode a row that exists on
only one side has its other half filled with `╱` — an absent line is visibly absent rather
than looking like an empty one.

**A lit row steps its own colour.** The cursor's row and a selected one have the same
problem, and it took a split row to make it visible. Both were drawn as a colour over the
whole row, and a changed line paints every one of its spans with its change colour, which
a line style sits under. So on a changed line the colour was simply not seen — and on a
split row where the line exists on one side only, the hatched half has no colour to
defend, took the tint, and left the half carrying the change looking idle. Half a row lit
is not a cursor.

What a lit row wears instead is its **own** tint, moved away from the ground: a deletion
stays red and an addition green, and the row reads edge to edge. The step is measured, not
chosen — the distance from a line's tint to its own gutter block, which a selection takes
half of and the cursor's row takes whole. So a selection can never reach the block beside
it, the cursor can never pass it, and the cursor is always the further of the two: it is
one end of a selection, and a run whose moving end is the quieter reads backwards. The
word-emphasis colours move by the same step, so lighting a row changes nothing about which
words changed. A line with no colour of its own — a context line, and the hatched half of
a split row — takes the plain cursor or selection tint, which is what it always took.

**The cursor is also that block, brighter — and a bar beside the frame.** The line-number
cell takes the brighter twin of the block it wears anyway, which keeps a deleted line red
and an added one green while making the cursor the strongest cell in the column. An
unchanged line has no block of its own and takes the plain cursor grey. The cell never
changes width, so moving the cursor never shifts the pane sideways. The block is what
separates the cursor's row from the rest of a selection, since both now carry a colour.

Only a diff row has a line number, though, and `space`, `c` and `z` all act on rows that
do not: a hunk header, a fold, a context boundary. On those the cursor was a faint tint
and nothing else. So a **bar sits in the cell just inside the pane's frame** on every
selectable row, keeping that cell's own background — over a lit block it stands on the
change colour rather than punching a hole in it. One thing to look for, on every row.

**Both gutters light.** A split row is one row, so a cursor drawn on the left half alone
read as a cursor on that side's line. The absent side keeps a blank line-number cell of
the same width, so the block lands in the same column on a row that exists on one side
only — where a marker glyph used to vanish into the `╱` fill.

**A hunk is a pill and an edge.** Its header is a band of `╱` hatch, and a pill appears on
it only for the hunk the cursor is in — ` +25 −3 · C31 `, the size of the change and then
the shape class — rather than a `@@ -479,0 +480,25 @@` line: every row
carries both line numbers in its gutter, so the coordinates repeated what was already on
screen in a notation you had to decode. What the header uniquely says stays on it: the
counts, the class, the reviewed mark, the finding count, and the group's id where that is
not already obvious. The counts lead: how much changed is what a reader sizes a hunk up by,
and putting a class token they cannot read at a glance in front of two numbers they can
made the size the second thing on the row. It remains a selectable row, so `n`/`N` jump to it and `space`
and `c` act on it.

Below the pill, a vertical **edge** runs down the hunk's changed rows. Deliberately not a
box: closing one top and bottom with horizontal rules cut the file into slabs and broke the
flow of reading down it. An edge says where a hunk begins and ends without chopping up the
page.

**The edge is the pane's own border.** It sits in that column rather than a cell inside it,
so it costs the content no width and there are never two vertical lines a cell apart. The
pill **starts against that border**, with no cell of gap: the pill caps the edge that runs
down the hunk beneath it, and a gap read as two marks that happened to line up rather than
as one mark and the run it opens.

Which is why a **frame never lights** — a pane's or a float's. Focus is carried by the
**title**, in the same colour the border used to take. A lit frame drew a box around half the screen to
say a thing about the cursor, and it competed with the hunk edge — the one border in this
view that means something. The title is where a reader looks to know which pane they are
in anyway. For the same reason the plan's connector wears **one** colour, the border grey:
it says which rows are tied together, and the rows themselves say what they are.

**Only the hunk the cursor is in wears a colour**; every other edge is muted to the gutter,
because a screenful of accents is no accent at all. Which box is lit is a cursor question
and the cursor moves without rebuilding rows, so a row carries the colour it *would* take
and drawing chooses. What it changes is the header's **whole content**: idle, the row is
hatch and nothing else; the cursor moving in is what puts the pill there, its leading cell
lit in the accent so the marker and the run below it read as one thing rather than as a
label that happens to sit above a line.

A pill on every header was a column of labels down the page competing with the code they
label, and the one worth reading is the hunk you are in. Entering a hunk is one keypress,
and it is the same press that makes its header worth reading.

What an idle header keeps is the **marks**: the group's id where the hunk is foreign, `✓`
where its class is read, and `◆ N` for the findings filed against it. Those are facts about
the hunk and they are what a reader scans a file for; the class and the counts describe it,
and describing every hunk at once is the column that was in the way. The hatch carries the
rest of the row, so a hunk still begins somewhere visible without a word on it.

Filling the whole pill said this far more loudly than it needed to — a block of colour the
eye went to before the code — and it cost the palette a second, darker ink for every span
that could sit on a pill, since `add_fg`/`del_fg` glow on a dark background and vanish on a
bright one. One cell needs no twins, so the `+N`/`−M` counts are one pair everywhere. The
fill stays bright: that lit cell is cyan for your hunk and a muted cyan for a foreign one,
and a darker fill put the two too close to tell apart.

**Cyan is where you are.** The pane title wears it, the cursor's bar wears it, and so does
the edge of the hunk you are reading — one colour for one idea, rather than a third accent
to learn. A hunk already **reviewed** wears green instead: that is the one fact worth
seeing at a glance on a hunk you have been through. A **foreign** hunk wears the same cyan,
**muted** — it is real code you asked to see, so it belongs to the same family, but it is
not on this reading list and a full accent would say it was.

Headers and boundary rows rule out to the pane edge and cross the split separator, because
what they describe is not one side of the file. A boundary **divides**, so its rule runs on
both sides of a centred label; a header **labels** what follows it, so it starts at the left
and stays there — a label that drifted with the pane width would be harder to scan down a
column.

A **context boundary** is a control, not a caption: a tinted band across the pane with its
arrow in the border column, **lighter on the cursor's row** — a control the reader is
standing on has to look like the one they are about to press, and the band carries its own
colour the whole way across, so the tint that marks the cursor everywhere else never
showed through it. It says `29 lines hidden` or, once the gap is spent,
`next: C42 "Group 42"` — and, on the cursor's row, `z shows 10` or `z shows it`, straight
after the label rather than out at the pane's edge, where a key is a key you have to go and
look for — a control that does not say how to work it is a label. But a screenful of bands each naming
the same key is a wall the reader stops reading, so the key appears on the **cursor's row
only**. Whether a row is the cursor's is a cursor question, so the row carries the text and
drawing chooses — the same way a hunk's accent works, one column over.
Where two boundaries are the two ends of one gap they carry the **same** count, so opening
one end drops the other's figure too. Deliberately not `@@ …` — that is the notation the hunk headers
dropped, and the gutters either side already carry the numbers.

Where two blocks meet, the two boundary rows describing that one gap sit **adjacent with no
blank between them**, so the seam reads as one band. They stay two rows while there is a
direction to choose — each keeps its own `z`, so no key has to mean two things — and both
carry the **same** count, since they are two ends of one gap and opening either shortens it.

Two rows exist to offer a **direction**. Where both ends would do the same thing there is
none to offer and the second row only repeats the first, so one `↕` band speaks for both.
That happens two ways: one press would close the gap — which point depends on
`context_step`, so a wider step collapses the seam sooner — or both ends are spent and name
the *same* hunk beyond, which is what an unlisted hunk sitting between two blocks looks
like from either side.

Pills are square. The half-circle caps that would round them are drawn at inconsistent
widths across terminals and fonts, and a pill a cell wider in one terminal than another is
worse than a pill with corners.

**Context is expandable.** Canonical `-U0` hunks carry no context, so it is read out of the
base and head blobs — three lines either side by default. Where more of the file is
available, the pane says so on a **boundary row** at each end of what is shown
(`── ↑ 16 more above ──`); put the cursor on it and `z` pulls in another step.
Both numbers come from `[review]` in the user config (`context`, `context_step`), as do
the palette (`theme`) and the layout a review opens in (`diff`, default `split`).

A layout **default** is not a layout **setting**. `s` toggles, and the toggle is recorded
against that review; a review with a recorded choice keeps it whatever the config later
says. So changing `diff` never moves the layout under someone midway through a read, and a
review that has never been toggled has nothing recorded at all. Expand
two hunks until their windows meet and the boundary rows between them disappear: the file
reads as one continuous stretch, each hunk keeping its own header band so `n`/`N` and
findings still work. A gap between two blocks keeps a boundary at each end rather than
collapsing to one — a step only reveals part of it, so both ends stay live. A boundary row is deliberately **not** a hunk — `space` and `c` ask
for one rather than acting on a row that is only about how much of the file is visible.

**A symbol says what declares it.** A declaration the reader cannot see is being
withheld like anything else `z` opens, which is why it is the same key rather than one
more. On a code row whose line uses a name the change declares, `z` lights that name and
floats the declaration — its own lines, syntax-highlighted, with their own numbers, under a
title of `name · file:line · class · group`. The group id is there because the reader's
next move is often to go and read that group first, and the id is what the plan pane's rows
and their `after:` lines are keyed by.

**The line says so before the key is pressed.** Standing on a row **underlines** every name
on it the change can resolve, and the one the float is answering takes the accent as well.
Without that a reader would have to press `z` on every line to learn which ones have
anything to say, and the key would be one nobody found. The mark is an underline — a shape,
not a colour — so a name keeps its syntax ink and the row gains nothing competing with its
change tint.

**The float says what the change did to what it shows.** Its lines wear the same tint the
diff behind them does: a line the change wrote takes the addition colour, in the code and in
its number cell, and a line that was already there takes none. Colour carries the change
here exactly as it does in the pane, so there is no `+` column. Without it a declaration the
change merely touched would read as one it introduced. A line the change REMOVED is never
shown — the float reads the head blob, and a removed line is not in it.

**It never covers the row it is about.** That row is the question and the float is the
answer; an answer laid over the question is worse than none. So it takes the larger of the
two gaps and stops one row short — below by preference, because reading runs downwards and a
float below keeps the eye travelling the way it already was. A pane with fewer than three
rows either side yields the float entirely, the same rule the group map follows.

**One press, one symbol, left to right.** A line can use several names, so `z` steps through
them in column order; past the last one it closes rather than wrapping, since a wrap answers
a question already answered and offers no way out through the key being pressed. `esc`
closes it, and so does moving the cursor — a highlight pointing at a row the cursor has left
is worse than no highlight.

**Only what the change itself declares.** The tool parses the files a diff touches and no
others, so a call into an untouched helper lights nothing and `z` keeps the meaning it
already had on that row. What it can resolve, it resolves on **any** line it draws, context
included: a reader who opened a window with `z` can ask about what they find there.

**A window stops at a neighbouring hunk, and says so.** Grouping is by shape class, so one
file routinely holds hunks belonging to several groups. When a window reaches one this view
does not list, the boundary row does not vanish — it **names** it
(`↓ next: C31 "Rename sweep"`), and another `z` pulls that hunk in. So a long
expansion can never silently swallow someone else's change, and a wall can never be
mistaken for the end of the file. A boundary row disappears at one place only: a real file
edge.

A crossed hunk carries a **dashed** edge and its owning group's **id**
(`╌ +25 −3 · C31 · g7 ╌`) — the id alone, since a label is a sentence and the header would
then be longer than the code under it — real code the reviewer asked to see, plainly not on
this group's reading list. The id is what the plan pane's rows and their `after:` lines are
keyed by, so it is what turns "some other group" into a row you can go and look at. It is absorbed whole
and costs no context budget, because showing half a change would be worse than showing
none. `n`/`N` pass over it, since it is not on this reading list. `space` and `c` treat it like
any other hunk: a reviewed mark and a finding both key on the hunk's digest, and both are
group-independent — so reading it here is reading it everywhere, and
a finding filed here is filed against the hunk itself rather than against this view of it.

That a crossed hunk is a **change** segment, never flattened into context, is what keeps
the numbers honest. Between two hunks the old/new line offset is constant, which is what
lets one context stretch carry both sides' numbers from a single length; across a hunk it
is not, and a change segment carries each side explicitly.

Only the lines actually drawn are diffed and highlighted — per hunk, `similar` runs over
the changed lines alone and syntect over the window plus a fixed lookback, so a keypress
costs what is on screen rather than the size of the files the group touches (ADR 0021).
How far each hunk is expanded is **transient**, like an open fold: a reading aid for this
sitting, not a finding, so nothing about it reaches the sidecar store.

**The footer is the pills on the left, and the keys of this place on the right.** What
the review stands at goes on the left, as
pills — `0/88 classes reviewed` and `3 findings(F)` — because those are facts about the
review, the same as a group's role and a hunk's class, and they wore a run of grey words
that read as chrome. Each takes its own colour once it has something to say: green when
every class is read, magenta when anything is filed. The findings pill carries the key
that opens the list, because a count with no way to reach what it counts leaves the reader
asking where they are, and `F` is not a key a number can suggest. A transient message
follows them.

**So does a shifted pane**, ` +40 cols `, for exactly as long as the shift lasts. A reader
who shifted right and then moved to a short file otherwise sees an empty pane and nothing
that says why, and the way back is a key they would have to go and look for.

**A selection gets a pill too**, ahead of the tallies: ` selecting 3 lines `, present for
exactly as long as the mode is. Being mid-selection is a fact about the thing in front of
the reader, which is what a pill says here — and the count is the point, because a
selection stops at a context boundary and is not always the distance the cursor
travelled. It replaced a passing message, which put a MODE in the same grey slot that
`finding saved` uses for something already over.

**The message is transient because the next keypress clears it.** A status line answers
"what did that key just do", so the next key is exactly when the answer stops being
wanted. The clear happens once, on the way into key handling — not at the thirty-five
places that write one.

**Against the right edge sit the keys of where the reader is standing**, and `? help`
behind them. Three keys that change with the place are three keys a reader reads; ten
fixed ones were a wall they stopped seeing. So the plan pane names `enter open · space
reviewed · f tree`, the diff pane names `c note · space reviewed · v select`, an open
selection names `j/k extend · c note · esc drop`, and a review thread names `r reply · x
resolve` — with `c edit · dd delete` beside them on a comment of the reader's own. A
label says what the key WILL do: `f tree` in the plan view, `f plan` in the file view,
`x reopen` on a thread the forge has resolved.

A modal names its keys in its own footer, so the window's footer names none of them: it
keeps the pills and `? help`, and that is all. In the composer and the two `y` questions
it drops `? help` too, because `?` is a character in one and the answer no in the others.

**`q` is on none of them.** It is in `?`, beside `ctrl-c`, which quits from anywhere —
the composer included, where a draft is the only thing lost and every saved finding is
already on disk. A reader who is lost is exactly the reader who cannot find the key that
gets them out, and one key that always works is worth more than a word on every screen.

**When the row is too narrow, the keys go one at a time from the left**, and the pills
and `? help` are what is left: the keys are the convenience, and `?` is the way to every
one that did not fit.

**`?` answers for where the reader is standing.** Three sections: the place's own keys
under its name, then the keys that mean the same thing anywhere — `s`, `w`, `h/l  ·  0`,
`F`, `y`, `P`, `R`, `?` and `q  ·  ctrl-c` — then **getting about, in one run at the
bottom**: `j/k`, `J/K  { }`, `n/N`, `ctrl-d/u`, `g/G` and `tab`. Acting comes before
moving because a reader opening `?` is asking what they can DO here, and the movement keys
are the ones they already know; last is where a reference belongs. Movement is ONE run
because "how do I move" is one question, and finding `j/k` under the place and `g/G` three
sections later makes the reader ask it twice. `j/k` is the exception that proves it, and
says what it does in THIS pane. Keys only: a wheel is not something a reader presses, so
the mouse is in [the paragraph below](#keys) and not in the modal. Inside a modal the second
section is absent, because those keys do not work there; the modal's own keys are the
whole answer. `?` can be pressed inside the file list and the findings list, and the list
comes back when help closes, on the entry it was on.

**One table feeds both lists.** The footer's short words and the modal's long ones are
rows of the same table, chosen by the same question about where the reader is, so the two
cannot drift the way a footer and a modal that each held their own list did.

## Keys

The full reference. `?` shows the subset that applies where the reader is standing.

| key | action |
|---|---|
| `j`/`k` | move (groups pane: switch group · diff pane: move over rows) |
| `J`/`K`, `{`/`}` | previous / next group |
| `tab`, `enter` | switch pane focus |
| `ctrl-d`/`ctrl-u` | half page |
| `g`/`G` | top / bottom |
| `n`/`N` | next / previous hunk (skipping hunks crossed in from other groups) |
| `z` | show what is being withheld, in the pane you are in — diff pane: on a `──` context boundary row, more of the file, or the hunk it names · on a resolved review thread, open or close it · **on a code row whose line uses a symbol the change declares, what declares it** (again for the next symbol on the line, once more to close; `esc` closes too) · elsewhere, the skim remainder or noise group · plan pane, file view: a directory |
| `s` | toggle side-by-side / unified diff layout (persisted) |
| `w` | soft wrap long lines (persisted) |
| `h`/`l`, `0` | shift the diff pane eight columns sideways · back to the left edge. Diff pane only; refused while `w` is on |
| `f` | files, in the pane you are in — plan pane: toggle reading plan ↔ file tree (persisted) · diff pane: the file-list modal (`enter` jumps to the file) |
| `space` | mark reviewed — the whole selected group/file in the left pane, the **hunk** under the cursor in the diff pane |
| `v` | start a line selection at the cursor · `j`/`k` extend it · `v` or `esc` drops it · `c` writes a finding over it |
| `c` | write a finding — on the line under the cursor, on the lines `v` selected, or on the whole hunk from a row that is not a line; on a line that already carries one, rewrite that one |
| `dd` | delete the finding under the cursor |
| `y` | copy the summary of open findings not yet on the request — a markdown list of `file:lines: note`, and nothing about groups: a group is how this reviewer chose to READ the branch, and the summary is pasted somewhere that has no idea what `g7` was. `dfr findings <range> --summary` prints the same text |
| `F` | every finding and every review thread in one list — `enter` jumps to one, `dd` deletes a note, `D` clears the notes not on the request (published notes and threads stay), `y` copies, `P` publishes, `esc` closes |
| `r` on a review thread | draft a reply under it — the reader's own thread or anyone's — a finding carrying the thread's id until `P` publishes it ([forge.md](forge.md)) |
| `c` on a comment of yours | rewrite it on the forge — yours by author, marker or address; on anyone else's, the footer says `not your comment` |
| `dd` on a comment of yours | delete it on the forge and here — asks first, only `y` means yes; on anyone else's, the footer says `not your comment` |
| `x` | resolve or reopen the review thread under the cursor, on the forge, at once |
| `R` | fetch the request's review threads again |
| `P` | publish the open findings to the request as one review — a float first says what goes and what stays and why; `y` sends, any other key keeps them local |
| `?` | help — the keys of where the reader is standing, then the keys that work anywhere. Pressed in the file list or the findings list, it gives that list back |
| `q`, `ctrl-c` | quit — state is saved on every change, quitting never loses anything. `ctrl-c` quits from every mode, the composer included, where it drops the draft in the box |

**The mouse acts on the pane under the pointer, and that pane takes focus.** The wheel is
`j`/`k` there — one row per notch in the diff, one entry per notch in the plan — and the
horizontal wheel is `h`/`l`, and so is the ordinary wheel with shift, alt or ctrl held, since
most mice have no sideways wheel — three keys because several terminals keep shift for
themselves as the "select text anyway" key while a program has the mouse, and never send it
on (Ghostty's `mouse-shift-capture`, off by default, is one). A click selects the row or
entry under it; a click on what is already selected is `enter`; a click on a row the cursor cannot land on — the group header,
a blank — leaves the cursor where it was. The two floating overviews are maps, and a click
on one does nothing. In the file-list and findings modals the wheel steps the list, a click
selects an entry, a second click is `enter`, and a click outside the box closes it. Help and
a notice close on a click. **A footer names its keys, and each is a button**: a click
on `enter save`, `esc close`, `dd delete`, the `y` of a question, or any key on the
window's own footer presses that key, through
the same handler a hand reaches — so in the composer and the two `y`-only questions the
footer is the one thing the mouse can touch.

One notch is one row because the reviewer **captures the mouse**. Without capture a terminal
fakes the wheel as arrow keys on an alternate screen, usually three per notch, and one notch
jumped three rows. Capture costs the terminal's own drag-select; shift-drag or option-drag
still selects text in most terminals.

**`y` must never trap the text.** The clipboard `arboard` reaches is the one on the
machine the process runs on, and a remote session has none — so over SSH `y` reported
`clipboard unavailable` and the summary was unreachable from inside the reviewer. Two
routes now, and a command that always works:

1. **`arboard`**, when a local display exists. The footer says the summary was copied.
2. **OSC 52** otherwise — an escape sequence the remote host does not interpret and the
   reader's own terminal does, because that terminal owns the real clipboard. It is
   wrapped for tmux and screen when either is detected, and **refused rather than
   truncated** when the encoded payload passes 8 KB, which is where several terminals
   stop.

OSC 52 has no reply to read, so a terminal that ignored the sequence looks exactly like
one that took it — which means the footer must never claim the copy landed. It names
`dfr findings <range> --summary` instead, with the range the reader typed filled in:
`sent via the terminal · dfr findings main..feature --summary`. That command prints the
same text, from the same store, through the same projection — `ReviewSession::
findings_summary`, which is why the two can never drift. The picker leaves no range to
name, so the reader is told the flag and supplies the rest.

## No range: the picker

`dfr review` with no arguments opens a picker instead of failing. It has a list of recent
commits from which you pick the **base**, and — **only when the worktree has uncommitted
changes** — a checkbox, **include uncommitted changes (worktree)**, ticked by default. The
review then runs from that commit to the worktree snapshot (box ticked) or to `HEAD`
(unticked or absent), which is how "everything on my branch since `main`, including what I
haven't committed" is expressed.

The checkbox is hidden on a clean worktree because it could not change anything: with
nothing outstanding the snapshot is `HEAD`'s own tree, so ticking it would re-hash every
tracked file to produce an identical review, filed under a different identity. Cleanliness
is detected with plumbing — `diff-index` for tracked changes, `ls-files --others` for
untracked ones — and errs toward showing the box, since a wrong "clean" would hide an
option you need while a wrong "dirty" costs one harmless row. The range is `base..head`, so it
**excludes the base commit's own changes**: the bar covers the commits above the cursor,
and the selected row is marked as the boundary. Picking the newest commit with the box
unticked therefore reviews nothing, and the title says so — which on a clean worktree is
the only thing picking the newest commit can mean. Commits show the branch and tag names
pointing at them (read with `for-each-ref`, plumbing, so no dependence on
`log.decorate` config), and a leading bar marks every row inside the range as the cursor
moves, so what is covered is visible while choosing. `HEAD` itself is a valid base: with
the box ticked it means "just my uncommitted work". The mouse works here as in the reviewer:
the wheel moves the cursor a row, a click selects the row under it, a second click picks it,
and a click on the checkbox ticks it.

Uncommitted sources run the full grouped pipeline like any range (ADR 0017); their review
identity keys on the base sha plus the stable literal `WORKTREE`, so marks and findings
survive while the snapshot tree churns with every edit. A committed pick keys on `HEAD`
as typed, so the review survives new commits landing.

A clean worktree is therefore a committed pick, filed under `HEAD`. One consequence worth
knowing: commit your outstanding work mid-review and the next `dfr review` opens the
`HEAD`-keyed review, not the `WORKTREE`-keyed one you were in. Nothing is lost — the old
review is still on disk under its own id — but its marks are not the ones you see. A
`WORKTREE` review is never adopted and never adopts (ADR 0026): its head is a synthesized
tree, and ancestry says nothing about a tree.

## While the pipeline runs

The reviewer opens immediately and shows a splash until the document is ready:
enumerate → classify → group → order, the active stage spinning, with an elapsed timer and
a grouping line that changes every few seconds.

That stage shells out to an LLM on a cache miss and dominates the wait, so its line is the
one anybody is actually looking at, sometimes for minutes. It **rotates**: first the agent
it is waiting on ("asking Claude Code"), then a handful of short lines about what the stage
is doing, four seconds each, round and round. Every line is true — the rotation is there so
a long wait has something to read, not to fill it with noise. A cache hit does not rotate;
it says the cache spared the call and leaves it there, because that path never waits.

The clock is the **agent call's**, not the splash's. Enumerate and classify run first, so a
rotation counting from the moment the splash opened is already several lines deep by the
time this row has anything to say — and the line that names the agent, which is the one
piece of information on it, would be the one line a reviewer never sees.

It rotates only while grouping is the **active** stage. Once the pipeline moves on the row
takes its tick and falls back to its static description, like every other finished stage:
a line still cycling next to a ✓ reads as work still going on.

The agent slot names the agent's **name**, not its command line: the argv is four times the
width of the line and answers a different question, so it lives where it is the answer, in
the text of a spawn failure (`LlmBackend::name`).

The block does not move while the line changes underneath it. The indent is measured from
every string that can appear there — the stage descriptions and the rotating messages, all
fixed at compile time — and never from the line currently on screen, so a block that shifts
sideways mid-wait is not a thing this screen can do. A message longer than the budget would
widen the block rather than slide it, and on a narrow pane push it off the left edge, which
is why the copy is capped and the cap is a test. `q` cancels, and
cancelling kills the agent subprocess rather than merely stopping the screen from
watching it: raw mode has already disabled `Ctrl-C`, so nothing else would reap it.

### The terminal is told too

The splash says everything, and the splash is the one thing a reviewer who started a
review and switched windows is not looking at. Two escape sequences put the same state
somewhere they can see without switching back. Both address the terminal emulator they
are sitting AT, which is what makes them work over SSH where a library would not — the
argument `osc::clipboard` settles for the clipboard, applied twice more.

A **progress bar** on the tab, for the whole wait (OSC 9;4, the ConEmu extension). The
four stages are equal quarters and a running stage is drawn at its own midpoint, so the
bar advances once per stage: 12, 37, 62, 87. The exception is an uncached grouping call,
which goes **indeterminate** — it is a subprocess with a long deadline and no progress of
its own, and a bar frozen at 62% for a minute reads as the hang this is here to disprove.
A cache hit keeps its quarter, because it does not wait.

The bar comes down on every way out: finished, cancelled, failed, panicked. That is why
it is an RAII guard and not a pair of calls.

A **desktop notification** when the wait ends (OSC 9), saying the review is ready or that
preparing it failed. It fires **only when an agent call ran**. A cache hit prepares in
seconds, and a reviewer who is still watching does not need telling what is in front of
them. The consequence to know: a run that fails before the grouping call sends nothing,
and that run was short enough that nobody had looked away.

Both sequences are write-only. A terminal that does not implement them is silent and
indistinguishable from one that does, so neither is ever reported as having arrived, and
neither is the only way the reviewer learns anything. There is no config key: the terminal
already owns whether it draws a bar and whether it raises a notification.

## State

Everything persists through the engine's `ReviewSession` — the TUI is a stateless
frontend that reads and mutates review state only via the session, which writes the
sidecar store (spec/persistence.md) under
`<git-common-dir>/differential/reviews/<review-id>/`, where the review id derives from the
resolved base sha plus the head **as typed** — reviewing `main..feature` keeps one review
while `feature` moves. A spelling with no review of its own adopts one filed on the same
line of history, so `main..<sha>` and `main..HEAD` are one review and a new commit does not
strand what you have read (ADR 0026); the status line says so on the open that adopts.

A rebase is outside adoption: it rewrites both endpoints, so neither reaches its old self.
`dfr review --name <name>` files the session under that name instead, and then no endpoint
is in the key (ADR 0027).

Reviewed marks key on the exact hunk digest (ADR 0025), so changing one hunk of a class
leaves the rest read. Findings anchor on the same digests and re-anchor on every open
(exact digest → content match flagged *moved* → orphaned, never dropped; orphans revive
when content returns). The pane title shows an orphan count when any exist.

**A finding is about lines.** `c` on a diff row annotates **that line**; `v` first starts a
selection the cursor extends, and `c` then annotates the run.

A selection **stops at a context boundary, and at a file header** — the two rows that stand
for a stretch of file the reader is not looking at. Walking past one moves the cursor but
not the selection: a gap they never opened is a gap they never read, and a note claiming
those lines claims something nobody said. **Nothing else breaks a run**: a hunk's header,
its removed and added rows, a note already filed on one of them are all one continuous
stretch of one file, and a selection has to cross them. A run is in ONE side's numbering,
the anchor's, and a row that exists in both files answers for either. The highlight shows
exactly what `c` will file, so it needs no message to explain it.

`v` is a toggle: pressing it again drops the selection, as `esc` does, and `c` leaves by
using it. On a row that is not a line of
a file — a hunk header, a fold — `c` annotates the whole hunk, which is what every finding
used to do.

The anchor is stored as an **offset into the hunk** — signed, since context sits on both
sides of one — not as a line number. The digest fixes
the hunk's content, so a hunk that moved in the file still holds the same line at the same
offset — while its absolute number did not survive the move. ADR 0013 is unchanged by this:
the anchor is still the digest, with a position inside it. A record written before offsets
existed reads `0`, which lands it on the hunk's first line — exactly where it was.

A finding is **drawn under the line it annotates**, so a note and its subject are read
together. One whose line is not on screen — the context around it still folded, or a
regeneration that could only re-anchor it to the hunk — falls back to its hunk's header,
where they all used to sit.

A row that exists in **both** files carries both its numbers, and a note anchored to either
belongs on it. A modification is two rows in the unified layout — the removed line and the
added one, each anchoring to its own side — and one row in the split layout; without the
other number a note written on the removed half had nowhere to land after an `s`, and fell
back to the hunk's header.

**Standing anywhere in a note lights all of it** — every line it covers and the note
itself: the border column runs the findings colour down them, and the note's rail takes it
too. A note is drawn under its **last** line, so over a range the note and most of the run
are not adjacent at all, and adjacency was the only thing that said they belonged together.
Standing on the first line of a run is standing in the note about that run, which is what
`c` there rewrites.

**`c` on a line a note already covers opens THAT note**, with its text in the box and
the cursor at the end. Two notes on one line would each be half the story, and there was no
way to fix a typo but delete and retype. A **selection** is the exception: picking a run of
lines is asking for a note about the run, so `v` then `c` always files a new one. Emptying
the box does not delete the note — that is `dd`, which is a deliberate press, where a note
lost to a stray keystroke and an `enter` would not be.

It is drawn as a **quoted panel**: every line of the note behind a muted rail, in muted
italics. It is prose the reviewer wrote about the code above it, so it has to read as a
different kind of thing from the code without competing with it — which one truncated line
under a bright marker glyph did not. Every line of the panel is a finding row, so `dd`
deletes the note from any of them and the cursor never lands on a line belonging to
nothing.

**Every finding, in one list.** `F` opens it, from either pane — findings are a fact about
the review rather than about a pane, unlike `f`. Each row is where the note is and what it
says: `src/app.rs:1307   this overflows on a narrow pane`. `enter` puts the cursor on the
note, **wherever in the review it lives**. A note's rows exist only in the view that is
built — the plan view builds the selected group's, the file view the selected file's — so
reaching one is a navigation, not a row index: select the group or the file that owns it,
let the rows rebuild, then find the row again by the note's id. Folded context is not in
the way, since a note whose line is hidden hangs off its hunk's header instead; a folded
skim remainder is, and is opened. An orphan has no row at any depth of unfolding and says
so. `dd` deletes the selected
note and the list stays open — a reviewer clearing up has more than one to clear. `D` asks
`delete all 4 local notes? (2 on the request stay)  y / n`, and only `y` means yes: `dd`
deletes one without asking because a note is one line and rewriting it is `c`, while
clearing every local note is the only irreversible thing in this reviewer. Published notes
and threads stay: a published note is the request's, and deleting it is `dd`, which asks
and reaches the forge ([forge.md](forge.md)). With nothing local to clear, `D` says so
instead of asking.

**Orphans have their own section**, under a rule, and for them the list is not a
convenience but the only door. An orphaned note matches no line and no hunk digest, so no
row is emitted for it anywhere: before the list its body could not be read in the app at
all, `c` could not reopen it and `dd` could not reach it. The plan pane's title still counts
them, which is the signpost that sends a reader to `F`.

**Writing a finding** opens a float over the diff rather than a strip pinned to its foot:
a note is about lines you should still be able to see. Its border carries the file and line
range it will anchor to, and its footer the keys. The text **soft-wraps at word boundaries**
and the box grows with it, up to the body: a note is prose, and a line the reader cannot see
the end of is a line they cannot finish. The footer row stays clear of the text.

**`enter` saves.** A finding is usually one line, and the key that ends a line is the key a
reader reaches for to be done with it. A newline is `shift+enter` where the terminal
reports it, and a **trailing `\` before `enter`** where it does not — most terminals send
plain `enter` for both without the keyboard enhancements this reviewer deliberately does
not ask for, so `shift+enter` alone would leave some readers no way to write a second line.
`ctrl-s` saves as well: it costs one arm, and some terminals swallow it before the app ever
sees it, which is why it cannot be the only way.

A **paste** lands in the box whole. Bracketed paste is on precisely so a multi-line paste
arrives as one event instead of a run of keys each driving a normal-mode action; the event
was being dropped, which read as the box being broken.

## Review threads

When a forge call fails, the footer says so in a few words and a **notice** float shows the
forge's whole answer — the command, the exit code, its own message — wrapped; any key closes
it. A footer holds one line, and the rest of an error is what tells the reader what to do.

A review opened with `--pr` shows the request's review threads ([forge.md](forge.md)). They
are fetched on a worker thread the moment the reviewer opens, and again on `R`; the footer
wears a `syncing` pill while a forge call is out, and a `N threads` pill on every request
review. The loop draws nothing while a key handler runs, so no handler calls the forge:
every call goes out on a worker and lands between keys, one call at a time.

A thread is **drawn where a note is drawn**: under the last line it annotates, through the
same placement, behind the same rail. It wears a different ink because it is somebody
else's — each comment opens with `author · date` in bold, then its body **rendered as
markdown** (headings, emphasis, inline code, lists, links, and fenced code blocks run
through the diff's own syntect highlighter) in the ordinary text colour rather than a
note's italics; a reply steps in one indent. A **resolved thread is collapsed** to a single
header — `author · date · resolved · N comments · z to open` — and `z` opens or closes it;
opened, it renders dimmed throughout, markdown and all. An outdated thread's header says
`outdated`. A thread
whose line the plan does not hold hangs off its hunk's header like an orphaned-to-hunk
note; one nothing holds is counted in the footer's message and drawn nowhere. The date is
the day, not an age: an age needs a clock, and `2026-09-03` stays true tomorrow.

A thread's comment **always wraps**, as a note and a group's description do: it is prose,
and a comment cut at the pane edge is one the reader cannot answer. `w` governs code only.
Every row of a thread is a `Thread` row, so `r` and `x` work from any line of it, and the
cursor in one lights the cluster — the thread, its reply drafts, and the lines its anchor
covers — the way a note's cluster lights. `c` and `dd` on a comment that is not the
reader's own refuse and name the keys that do work: a thread is the forge's, and `r`
replies to it. A **reply draft** is a finding that carries the
thread's id; it is drawn straight after the thread it answers, stepped in like a reply, in
the note's own look, so what is on the request and what is not yet are told apart at a
glance. A published finding whose fetched twin is present is not drawn at all: the thread
is it now, and `y` leaves it out for the same reason.

**The list holds the threads too.** `F` lists the notes first, then the request's review
threads under a rule, then the orphans: what the reader has to say, what others have said,
and what has lost its line. A thread's row is `file:line  author: first line`, dimmed and
marked `(resolved)` when the forge says so; a published note whose twin is fetched is
listed once, as the thread, and one whose twin is not fetched yet is marked
`(published)`. `enter` on a thread lands on its rows; `dd` on one refuses as it does in
the diff. `P` works from the list as it does from the diff, and sends everything not yet
on the request. So does `y`, for the same reason: the list is where the reader sees what
the request does not have yet.

**`P` publishes, and asks first.** It is the one outward act in this reviewer, so the float
reads its whole consequence back before the question: how many new comments and replies go
to the request as one review, and which notes stay local and why — a line the request's
diff does not show, a reply whose thread is gone. Only a bare `y` sends; any other key
leaves everything where it was, with `nothing published` in the footer. The send is a
worker call like every other: the footer says `publishing N comments…`, then `published N
comments` when the forge has answered and the refetched threads have replaced the notes.
If the request's head moved since the review was built, nothing is sent and the footer
says where it moved to; the review has to be opened again on the new head.

## Findings contract

`dfr findings <range>` re-anchors and prints the findings as JSON — each record carries
`{id, created, body, status, moved, plan_hash, anchor: {file, side, line, end_line, offset,
span, hunk_digest, line_text, end_line_text}, reply_to, upstream}` (the last two are the
forge consumer's, [forge.md](forge.md)). `line`/`end_line` are the resolved numbers
for a consumer that only reads; `offset`/`span` are what survive a regeneration. All five
are additive with defaults, so an older `findings.jsonl` loads unchanged. `hunk_digest` keys back into the plan document's `hunks[].digest`, which is how agent
tooling acts on them; the forge consumer posts from the anchor itself. The `y` clipboard
summary is the human-readable projection: one markdown bullet per open finding not yet on
the request, `file:lines: note`. No group: a group is how this reviewer chose to READ the
branch, and the summary is pasted somewhere that has no idea what `g7` was.
