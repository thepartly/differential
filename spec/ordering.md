# The ordering stage

Reorders the grouped document foundation-first, so the reviewer meets the abstraction
before its consumers. The measured failure this fixes: in model order, the group
introducing the trait everything else consumed landed 9th of 13.

Deterministic and model-free; runs unconditionally after grouping inside
`run_grouped_pipeline`. Appends `"order"` to `generator.stages`.

## It does not build the graph

`artefact::graph` does, from **classes**, before the model runs (ADR 0022) — so the model
reads the same edges the ordering acts on, and grouping cannot change what depends on what.
This stage contracts that graph onto groups.

Symbol extraction is a **domain use case with pluggable readers** (ADR 0023). The graph asks
`SymbolReaders::of_file` once per changed file, handing it the **whole file** from the head
tree — not a hunk and not a line. A line inside a block comment or a multi-line string is
indistinguishable from code on its own, so the two cuts worth making are not decidable per
line. The answer is per new-side line number, and each class reads the lines its member
hunks added.

Each reader answers `priority(path)` with how good its answer would be, or nothing if it
does not read that file. The rule is: **ask the best claimant, fall to the next best if it
fails, and if nobody claims the file, take no symbols from it.** A reader ranks itself, so
no wiring order can get the ranking wrong.

Three readers ship. Which one answered is not a distinction this stage can see:

| reader | reads | definitions | references |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tuned | Rust, TypeScript (+TSX), Python, Go, Kotlin | from the tree, per query | calls, types, JSX names, and names reached by path, per query |
| field-rule | JavaScript, Java, C, C++, C# | from the tree | calls and types, from field names |
| crude | any other source extension | declaration keywords | every identifier ≥ 4 chars |

Which language sits in which row, and every extension:
[`crates/symbols/README.md`](../crates/symbols/README.md).

**A definition is a name others can use.** `mod template;` is not one — it names a module.
`fn from` inside `impl From<X> for Y` is not one — it is reached through the trait, and
shares its name with every conversion in the tree. Counting those made a single common word
into a globally unique symbol that every file mentioning it then linked to; six such words
produced 64% of one corpus range's edges. In a module language the keyword says it outright:
`export const Panel = …` and `export interface PanelProps` define, and a bare top-level
`const` or `type` does not — an unexported alias in a test file is not a name others can use.

A global name is matched **within its language** and not across (ADR 0031): the readers
hand the graph an opaque namespace token, and two global symbols are the same symbol only
when their namespaces match. Nothing here parses a monorepo's build graph, so a word two
languages share is never evidence that two packages are connected.

A method owned by ONE type is one, though (ADR 0030): `impl Service { fn load_batch }`
is the only place that name is declared, and other files reach it by that name. An inherent
`impl` and a trait `impl` are told apart by a negated field; Go's receiver methods and
Python's and Kotlin's class-body methods count on the same argument.

**A name reached by path is a reference whether or not it is called.**
`route(api::widgets::handler)` hands a function over, and only the callee position used
to be captured — so every registration table drew nothing.

**Every other name a declaration introduces is file-local, and draws edges only inside its
own file** (ADR 0030). A `const` in a function body, a parameter, an import binding, a
method: the graph keys these by `(file, name)`, so two files declaring `label` are two
symbols and neither can reach the other's uses. The tuned readers also take every identifier
as a possible file-local reference, which is what lets a value declared in one hunk and
rendered in the next three be seen at all — the change that prompted this drew no edges
whatever before it.

**A binding is a declaration in every position that introduces one**, not only after the
keyword that usually precedes it. `if let Some(first)`, a `for` target, an `except … as`
alias, a catch parameter, a walrus and every destructuring shape all declare their names.
The catch-all above is what makes this load-bearing: a binding a query fails to name is
not merely missed, it is taken as a READ — so the line declaring a name points at
whatever else in the file spells it the same way.

Rust is the one language that needs a convention to decide it. It writes a binding and a
unit variant with the same node — the `None` in `Ok(None)` is a bare identifier exactly
as the `a` in `Ok(a)` is — and no grammar can separate them without resolving names. So
the pattern captures read the case: a binding is snake_case, a variant or a const is not.
It is the only such rule in the queries, and a match arm's own child is left out of it
entirely, because there a variant path is the commoner shape.

Nothing here can manufacture the failure above: a file-local name is compared only against
its own file's answers, so the worst a wrong one costs is an ordering inside one file.

**Comments and strings contribute nothing**, which needs no query: every grammar names its
comment and string nodes with those words. A token reaching a string through an
interpolation is still code, so `"${resolve(id)}"` keeps its call.

Two categories contribute **no symbols at all** whatever the readers say: generated content
(a lockfile would otherwise appear to define half the dependency tree) and gitlinks, whose
only added line is `Subproject commit <oid>` — diff prose about a commit this repository
does not have, whose words are plausible identifiers. Both are skipped where the classes are
read, not only where the blobs are.

Beyond those, a file is not read when it cannot contribute: binaries carry no lines, and a
file whose every hunk is a pure deletion has no added line to attribute.

Withholding symbols is **classification, never enumeration**. The file, its hunks and its
classes all still exist (ADR 0005, 0012).

## Reorder

Only the **contiguous focus prefix** is reordered (skim/noise/back-fill placement is fixed
by the grouping stage; the audit back-fill group always stays trailing). Kahn's topological
sort, foundation-first; among ready groups the tie-break is descending hunk count, then
original model order.

Each group's `class_ids` is sorted foundation-first too, by the same rule. Those are the
intra-group edges the old group-level union discarded, and they are the only thing that can
order a group's members.

## Cycles

A cycle means no reading order satisfies every edge. The stage says which kind it is
rather than picking on size and staying silent.

- **`artefact`** — the class graph is acyclic here. Contracting classes into groups made
  the cycle: one group both defines and consumes, against the same other group. The class
  order decides which group is emitted first.
- **`mutual`** — the classes deadlock too. The mutual dependency is in the change, and the
  deterministic fallback (largest remaining group, ties by original position) is as good an
  answer as there is.

The verdict lands on `Edge.cycle`, and only on an edge the sort could not honour. *Whether*
it could is derivable from `rank`, so it is not recorded twice.

`pivot` counts the leading `class_ids` that depend on nothing ranked later — where the group
stops being a foundation and starts being a consumer.

**Nothing splits a group.** The merge is the model's judgement (ADR 0001), and the graph
that would undo it is heuristic. A wrong edge misorders; a wrong cut would break a coherent
group and mislabel both halves. The impossibility is information the reviewer wants.

## Roles

- focus group that at least one other group depends on → `foundation`
- focus group with only outgoing dependencies → `consumer`
- skim → `mechanical`; the noise group keeps `noise`; isolated focus groups and the
  back-fill stay `null`.

`rank` is rewritten to the final order; group ids are stable; the reading plan is
re-grouped to follow (per-group step sequences unchanged).

## Consumers

`depends_on` is emitted so a renderer can show the *chain*, not just the sequence — "this
group exists because of that one" — which is the legibility gap the validation session
called out. `via` says which symbol produced the edge, so a reader can judge it rather than
trust it. The ordering does not affect the grouping cache key: cached groupings are
re-ordered on every load by the same deterministic pass.
