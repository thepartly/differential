//! `dfr agents` — which agents exist, which one you have, and whether it works.
//!
//! Five agents ship (ADR 0032), and not one of their command lines can be
//! proved by a test in this repository. A test asserts the argv this crate
//! writes; whether the CLI on the other end accepts that argv, reads its prompt
//! from stdin, prints plain text and refuses to write is a fact about a program
//! that is not installed here and differs by version. CI cannot answer it and
//! neither can the author, who has one machine.
//!
//! So the answer moves to where the CLI actually is. `dfr agents` lists them and
//! costs nothing. `dfr agents --probe` runs one real call and reports four
//! facts, and it is the only thing in this repository that can tell you an argv
//! is right.
//!
//! The four facts are the four ways this goes wrong, and each one is quiet:
//!
//! - **Spawn.** The executable is missing or renamed. Loud already — this is
//!   here for completeness.
//! - **Stdin.** The agent took the prompt from argv, or printed a JSON envelope,
//!   or wrapped the reply in decoration. The grouping call would then fail to
//!   parse, minutes in, with a 300-character sample.
//! - **Fetch.** The agent could not run `<fetch> agent`. This is the expensive
//!   one and ADR 0022 says so: a model does not give up on a failing tool, it
//!   retries and works around it, and only then falls back to the class ids. The
//!   run succeeds. The grouping is quietly worse.
//! - **Write.** The boundary is gone. Nothing else would ever tell you.

1. Run this command and read what it prints:

2. Try to create a file at this exact path, containing any text:
