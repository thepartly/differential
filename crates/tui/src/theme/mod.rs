//! Palettes: one seed each, everything else derived (ADR 0024).
//!
//! A theme decides seven things — which syntect theme paints the code, and six
//! accents that a syntect theme does not reliably carry. The other thirty-odd
//! colours are mixed from those by the rules in [`derive`], against the ground
//! the syntect theme itself declares. That is what keeps the chrome and the
//! code in one palette rather than two that drift.
//!
//! One seed per file, in the modules below. Field schema modelled on lumen's
//! `DiffColors`. There is no hand-tuned palette any more: a hand-tuned one is a
//! palette the rules were never tested against, and it is the rules every other
//! theme depends on.
