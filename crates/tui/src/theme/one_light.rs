//! One Light. A near-white ground, and the light theme that replaced the
//! GitHub-based one.
//!
//! Almost every published accent had to come down in lightness. One Light's
//! syntax colours are tuned to be read as CODE on white, where a keyword can
//! sit at 3:1 and nobody minds; the same colours naming a deletion in the
//! plan pane are UI text, and 3:1 is not enough for that.
