//! Solarized, dark. Deep teal ground.
//!
//! Solarized is deliberately low contrast — it puts its own foreground 5.6:1
//! from its own ground, where Monokai manages 15:1. That is the palette this
//! derivation's adaptive muting exists for: a fixed mute fraction leaves its
//! quiet inks below 2:1 and unreadable.
//!
//! The red and the magenta are lifted above Solarized's published values,
//! which sit at 4.2:1 on this ground — under WCAG AA for text that names a
//! deletion.
