//! Catppuccin Latte. The light flavour.
//!
//! Catppuccin's light accents are the pastel problem in its sharpest form —
//! its green reaches 3.0:1 on this ground and its yellow 2.3:1, both well
//! under AA for text. Green, blue and yellow are all darkened; the red and
//! the mauve were already strong enough to stand.
