//! Solarized, light. Pale sand ground.
//!
//! The lowest-contrast palette shipped: Solarized Light puts its foreground
//! 4.1:1 from its ground, under WCAG AA before this crate touches it. That is
//! Solarized's design rather than a defect, so the legibility test holds each
//! theme to its own ceiling and checks that the DERIVATION does not make
//! things worse — see `every_theme_is_legible_on_its_own_ground`.
