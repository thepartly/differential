//! The forge, from the reviewer's side (ADR 0029, `spec/forge.md`).
//!
//! Every call to the forge is a subprocess that takes a second or more, and
//! the reviewer's loop draws nothing while a key handler runs. So no handler
//! calls the forge. It starts a worker thread, keeps the receiving end, and
//! the loop asks `poll_forge` on every turn whether the answer has arrived —
//! the same shape the splash uses for the pipeline, one call at a time.
//!
//! One call in flight at once. A second request while one is out is refused
//! with a message rather than queued: the reader can see the `syncing` pill
//! and press again, and a queue is state that has to be explained.
