//! Code adapted from other MIT-licensed projects, with attribution headers in
//! each file (see LICENSE-MIT and CREDITS.md).
//!
//! Trimmed to what this crate actually calls: the module is private, so the
//! compiler can see what is reachable, and everything it reported unreachable
//! is gone (a search feature that was never ported, the suspend/resume
//! terminal machinery, and — once the reviewer stopped highlighting whole
//! files, ADR 0021 — tuicr's split-diff sequence helpers and its no-op
//! `plain()` highlighter). Keep it that way — do not re-add a helper "for
//! later", and do not make the module public, which would make every `pub fn`
//! in it exported surface and silence the dead-code lint entirely.
//!
//! A unit test is not a caller: these had tests, which is why the lint stayed
//! quiet about them. Reachability means reachable from the crate proper.
//!
//! Adapted from:
//!
//! - `agavra/tuicr` — syntax highlighting and the terminal lifecycle. Its
//!   span-wrapping, search and truncation utilities were taken too and are the
//!   bulk of what the trim removed; the last of them, the row cutter, was
//!   rewritten and now lives in `crate::text_utils` as ours.
//! - `jnsahaj/lumen` — the blob-to-rows diff engine with word-level emphasis.
