//! OSC 9: the desktop notification the TERMINAL raises.
//!
//! The bar in `progress` shows the wait. This says it is over, to a reader who
//! is by then in another window — which is the only reader who needs telling.
//!
//! The terminal raises it, not this process. A notification library wants a
//! local desktop session, and the session that matters may be at the far end of
//! an SSH connection; the sequence travels the pipe that is already open. The
//! same argument `clipboard` makes, and it was settled there first.
//!
//! Write-only, like everything in this module. It carries a title and nothing
//! else: Ghostty's OSC 9 takes one string, and OSC 777 — the extension with a
//! separate body — it does not implement. One line, therefore, and the line has
//! to be the whole message.
