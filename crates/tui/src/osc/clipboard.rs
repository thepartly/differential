//! OSC 52: putting text on the clipboard of the terminal the reader is AT.
//!
//! `arboard` needs a local display server, which a remote session does not
//! have — so over SSH `y` reported `clipboard unavailable` and the summary was
//! unreachable from inside the reviewer. The clipboard the reader wants is on
//! their own machine, and no library running on the remote host can reach it.
//!
//! The escape sequence can. The remote host does not interpret it: the local
//! terminal emulator does, and that terminal owns the real clipboard.
//!
//! **It is write-only.** There is no reply to read, so a terminal that refuses
//! the sequence — several do, for good reasons — fails silently and looks
//! exactly like one that took it. That is why the caller must never treat a
//! sent sequence as a copy that landed: the way out is the command the footer
//! names, `dfr findings <range> --summary`, which prints the same text.
