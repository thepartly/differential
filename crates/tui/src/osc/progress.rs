//! OSC 9;4: the progress bar the TERMINAL draws, on its own tab.
//!
//! The splash screen already says everything about the wait. The splash screen
//! is also the one thing a reader who started a review and switched windows is
//! not looking at, and on a grouping cache miss that wait is an agent call with
//! a twenty-minute deadline. This sequence puts the same state somewhere they
//! can see without switching back: the tab, or the taskbar entry.
//!
//! The ConEmu extension, read by Ghostty, WezTerm and Windows Terminal among
//! others. Write-only like every sequence in this module (see the module
//! header), so nothing here may report that a bar appeared.
//!
//! The terminal drops a state it has not heard from in about fifteen seconds.
//! That is a floor on how often a caller must re-send, not a reason to re-send
//! often: `Bar::set` is idempotent and the splash redraws every 120 ms, so the
//! keep-alive costs nothing and needs no clock of its own.
