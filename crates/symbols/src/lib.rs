//! Symbol readers: the adapter side of `engine::artefact::symbols`.
//!
//! The engine owns the port and the rule for choosing between readers. This
//! crate owns the readers, and depends on the engine — never the reverse
//! (ADR 0020). Each reader ranks itself, so wiring is `register` calls in any
//! order.
//!
//! It lives apart from the engine for two reasons. It carries a tree-sitter
//! grammar per language, which the engine's own test builds should not pay
//! for. And the whole mechanism may move out of the engine later, in which
//! case the graph, the port and these readers travel together.
