# differential-symbols

The symbol readers for [`differential`](https://crates.io/crates/differential). They answer
one question about a file — **what does each line define, and what does it reference?** —
and the answer becomes the dependency graph that orders a review foundation-first.

Three readers ship. Each ranks itself for a given path, and the best claimant answers. The
regex floor stands under every extension the table below names, so a file an AST reader
claims and fails to parse still gets crude symbols rather than none. A file no reader
claims contributes no symbols at all.

## What each rung costs you

| reader | definitions | references | comments and strings |
|---|---|---|---|
| tuned query | from the tree, per language | calls, types, JSX names and paths, per language | dropped |
| field rules | from the tree | calls and types, by field name | dropped |
| regex floor | declaration keywords | every identifier of four characters or more | **counted** |
| none | — | — | — |

Both AST readers answer with a **scope** as well as a name (ADR 0030). A global name is one
other files can use, and its edges may cross a file; a file-local name — a binding inside a
function, a parameter, an import, a method — is keyed by `(file, name)` and draws edges only
inside the file it was read from. The tuned readers take every identifier as a possible
file-local reference, so a value declared in one hunk and read in the next is visible; the
regex floor has no scope to offer and its answers stay global.

Four consequences worth stating outright, because each one surprises.

**A file no reader claims still exists.** Its hunks are counted, its classes are formed, it
is read like anything else. It simply draws no dependency edges. Withholding symbols is
classification, never enumeration — nothing here can add or remove a hunk (ADR 0005, 0012).

**Falling a rung costs precision, not coverage.** A missing edge misorders a reading plan.
It can never hide a change.

**What a tuned query buys is knowing what a definition is not.** `mod template;` names a
module, and `fn from` inside `impl From<X> for Y` is reached through the trait — neither
introduces a name other files can use. The regex floor cannot tell either from a real
definition, and on one measured range six such words produced 64% of every dependency edge.
A query can also tell that apart from `impl Service { fn load_batch }`, which is a
definition: one type owns it, and callers elsewhere name it exactly (ADR 0030).

**A name is consumed by being named, not only by being called.**
`route(api::widgets::handler)` hands a function to a router. Capturing only the callee
position meant every registration table — routers, dispatch maps — drew no edge at all.

**In a module language, `export` is the whole predicate** — for a type as much as a value.
`export const Panel = …` and `export interface PanelProps` define; a bare
`const send = vi.fn()` or `type FormData = …` in a test file does not, and counting those
linked production files to the test. Unexported, they are still read as file-local names, so
they keep every edge they can honestly draw.

**A global name is scoped to its language.** `FormData` read from a Rust file and
`FormData` read from a TypeScript one are two symbols: nothing here parses a monorepo's
build graph, so a shared word is never evidence that two packages are connected (ADR 0031).
`namespace::of` is the table, and all three readers share it — the crude reader is the AST
readers' fallback, so a namespace of its own would split a language in two the first time a
parse failed. The floor's claim (`namespace::is_code`) reads the same table, so it cannot
know fewer extensions than the readers it stands under. This *raises* the edge count on a
mixed repository: a name declared once per language used to have two definers and be
dropped for both.

Comments and strings are dropped by both AST readers without any query, because every
grammar names those nodes with those words. A token that reaches a string through an
interpolation is still code, so `"${resolve(id)}"` keeps its call.

## How a language moves up

**To the field rules:** one entry in the table in `src/ast/generic.rs`, plus the grammar
crate. The reader probes each grammar when it is built and declines any whose shape its
rules cannot read, so a grammar that does not fit falls to the floor rather than answering
empty.

**To a tuned query:** the same, plus a `.scm` in `src/ast/queries` capturing `@def`,
`@call` and `@type`. Roughly ten patterns. Queries compile when the reader is built, so a
wrong node name fails immediately and names the node.

Kotlin is the worked example of why the top rung exists. Its `call_expression` carries no
`function:` field and its `navigation_expression` names none of its children, so the field
rules found no calls there at all. Nine of the other ten grammars passed those rules on a
probe before any of this was written.

Each query carries a version in the reader's fingerprint, which is part of the grouping
cache key. Editing a query therefore colds the cache by itself, and
`every_query_version_pins_its_patterns` pins each query's PATTERNS — its text with comment
and blank lines removed — against its version, so the bump cannot be forgotten and a
reworded comment does not cold every cached grouping for nothing. Change a pattern, bump
the `-vN`, paste the hash the test prints.

A query is not the only thing that can change an answer, so
`every_reader_fingerprint_pins_its_answers` hashes what each reader actually extracts from a
fixed set of samples and pins that beside its version too. It covers a change to the
readers' Rust — the gap that let the crude reader gain a namespace and keep `naive-v1` — and
it fails on a tree-sitter grammar upgrade, which it should: a new grammar can change
extraction, and nothing else in the tree would notice.

## What is proven against what

| reader | evidence |
|---|---|
| tuned query | Rust, Python and TypeScript run against a real multi-language corpus; TypeScript and TSX additionally against a React corpus, and Rust against a service-backend one. Go, Kotlin, Java and C# are covered by per-language tests only, and their method and path rules are unmeasured — see ADR 0030. The corpus ranges the parity test pins hold no Java or C# change, so the promotion moved neither range's edge count. |
| field rules | C, C++ and JavaScript, by per-language tests only. |
| regex floor | runs against the corpus wherever no grammar claims a file. |

On that corpus the readers took two ranges from 288 and 131 dependency edges down to 63 and
26, and the second range's twelve-class cycle — which left every class behind it impossible
to order — disappeared entirely.

## Known edges

- Rust's `(source_file (const_item …)) @def` does not check `pub`, so a private constant is
  global where an unexported TypeScript one is not. Predates the scope split, and moving it
  belongs to its own measurement (ADR 0030).
- `.jsx` goes to the field rules, which have no JSX rule — a rendered component draws no
  edge there. `.tsx` does, by query.
- Go's `@ref`, Python's, Java's and C#'s take struct-field and attribute reads too: those
  languages spell a qualified name and a member read the same way. Rust's
  `scoped_identifier` does not have this problem.
- C# has no `type_identifier` node — a type is a plain identifier in a `type:` field — so its
  query reaches types through a wildcard on that field rather than through a node kind. A
  type position the grammar spells with some other field name is missed.

## Using it

```rust
// The application wires the readers. Registration order does not matter —
// each reader ranks itself for a given path.
let symbols = differential_symbols::readers();

let out = run_pipeline(&repo, &src, &config,
                       &LanguageRegistry::builtin(), &symbols)?;
```

The engine owns the `SymbolSource` port and the rule for choosing between readers
(`engine::artefact::symbols`). This crate owns the readers and depends on the engine, never
the reverse. See
[`adr/0023-symbol-extraction-is-a-domain-port.md`](../../adr/0023-symbol-extraction-is-a-domain-port.md).
