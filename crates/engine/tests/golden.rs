//! Byte-level goldens for the things a refactor can break silently.
//!
//! The grouping cache is keyed by a content hash and stores the RAW model
//! response (ADR 0009). Three separate changes are individually invisible and
//! jointly catastrophic:
//!
//! - **The prompt text drifts while `PROMPT_VERSION` stays put.** Every cached
//!   entry then answers a prompt nobody would write today, and the cache still
//!   reports a hit.
//! - **The key composition changes.** Every user's cache misses at once, and
//!   the only symptom is that a re-run of a reviewed range calls the LLM again
//!   — which looks exactly like a slow first run.
//! - **The on-disk shape changes.** Existing entries become unreadable.
//!
//! None of these fail a behavioural test, so they are pinned here as exact
//! bytes. When one of these assertions fails, the question is never "what is
//! the new value" — it is whether `PROMPT_VERSION` should have been bumped.
//!
//! The sidecar layout is pinned for the same reason: it is the on-disk contract
//! that carries a reviewer's progress and findings across regenerations
//! (ADR 0013), and a moved file silently loses their work.
