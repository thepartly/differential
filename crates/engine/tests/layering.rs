//! The dependency direction, enforced (ADR 0020).
//!
//! Business logic owns the trait; the adapter implements it. So a domain
//! module must never name an adapter — not `gitio`, not the filesystem, not a
//! subprocess, not the process environment. The adapter depends on the domain,
//! and never the other way round.
//!
//! That rule is easy to state and easy to break by accident: adding
//! `use crate::gitio::Repo` to a domain module compiles, passes every test,
//! and quietly inverts the arrow back. So this is a **ratchet** rather than a
//! snapshot — `NOT_YET_INVERTED` lists the modules the ports migration has not
//! reached yet, and the test fails both when a module joins the list and when
//! an entry on it is no longer true. The list can only shrink, and it cannot
//! rot: finishing a module without deleting its line is also a failure.
//!
//! Scanning source text is crude, and normally rule 5 would send us looking
//! for a crate. There isn't a boring, widely-used one for intra-crate module
//! layering (`cargo-deny` and friends work at the crate graph level, which is
//! a coarser question than this one), and the check is a dozen lines of string
//! matching — so it is hand-rolled deliberately.
