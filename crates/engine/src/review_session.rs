//! An open review: the engine-owned session over one plan document.
//!
//! The engine is the backend; renderers are stateless frontends (ADR 0014).
//! A `ReviewSession` owns the store, the document, the diff view and all
//! mutable review state — reviewed marks, findings, resume cursor. Every
//! mutation persists before returning, so a renderer can crash at any point
//! without losing anything, and never touches the store itself.
