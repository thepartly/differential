//! Build the final tree from applied hunks, via plumbing against a temporary
//! index (ADR 0011). No checkout, no touching the user's index or worktree.
//!
//! Text file content is always computed BY APPLYING HUNKS — never by copying
//! head blobs — so tree equality against `head^{tree}` is a real assertion
//! (invariant 3). The two exceptions, both explicit here: binary files are
//! staged from the recorded head oid (they carry no hunks; documented
//! tautology), and submodules are staged as gitlinks from the pseudo-hunk's
//! commit id.
