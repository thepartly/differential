//! The frozen JSON contract for differential reading plans.
//!
//! This module is the product boundary (ADR 0008, superseded-in-form by ADR
//! 0018): every consumer (shadow-branch stack, TUI, forge review) depends on
//! these types and nothing else. It stays serde-only — consumer conveniences
//! and engine internals must not leak in here; that discipline is enforced in
//! review now that the crate boundary is gone.
//!
//! Contract rules:
//! - `schema_version` is 3 (v3 gave every dependency edge its cause and moved
//!   the graph onto `classes`, ADR 0022). Readers must reject versions they do
//!   not know.
//! - Deserialisation tolerates unknown fields, so additive changes are non-breaking.
//! - `groups`/`reading_plan` are `null` when the grouping stage has not run. That is
//!   distinct from `[]`, which would mean "grouping ran and produced nothing" and is
//!   always a bug. `generator.stages` states exactly which stages produced the document.
//! - Optional fields serialise as explicit `null`, never omitted.
