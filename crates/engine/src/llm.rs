//! LLM backend abstraction (ADR 0016; an engine module since ADR 0018).
//!
//! Nothing else in the engine may reach into subprocess machinery: grouping
//! and the pipeline consume only `LlmBackend`/`CommandBackend` from here.
//!
//! The grouping stage needs exactly one capability from a model: one-shot text
//! completion — prompt in, raw text out. The contract is deliberately that
//! narrow: no streaming, no chat state, no conversation to manage.
//!
//! It stays that narrow now that the model reads for itself (ADR 0022). Tools
//! run inside the CLI this spawns, so what crosses this seam is still a prompt
//! and a string. What changed is a flag in the argv below, not the trait.
//!
//! There are five agents, one constructor each, and the trait did not move to
//! make room for them (ADR 0033). What differs between them is the argv, and
//! the part of the argv that matters is how each one is stopped from writing:
//!
//! - **An allowlist** — `claude_cli`, `copilot_cli`. The agent may run the
//!   named tools and nothing else, and the fetch command is one of them.
//! - **An OS sandbox** — `codex_cli`, `droid_cli`. The agent may run anything
//!   and the kernel refuses the writes, so there is no allowlist to derive and
//!   `fetch` does not appear in the argv.
//! - **Nothing** — `pi_cli`. Pi ships no sandbox and no per-command allowlist,
//!   and the shell tool it needs to fetch is the one that also lets it write.
//!   That is a decision with a reason, recorded in ADR 0033 and in the
//!   constructor, and `config::Agent::read_only` is how a caller
//!   tells a user about it.
//!
//! Adding a sixth means a constructor here, a variant in `config::Agent`, and
//! an arm in the application layer's `backend_from`. The compiler asks for the
//! last two; this comment is the only thing that asks for the boundary.
