//! Ports: the traits the engine's business logic owns and adapters implement.
//!
//! Dependency direction only (ADR 0020). These exist so `pipeline`,
//! `invariants`, `tree`, `worktree` and `crates/stack` never name
//! `gitio::Repo` — each function's bound list is a reviewable statement of
//! exactly how much git it is allowed to touch, and `invariants` can no longer
//! so much as *express* `git log`.
//!
//! **Consumed by static dispatch.** There is exactly one implementation of
//! each git port, `gitio::Repo`, and ADR 0020 forbids a second one — a fake
//! git for tests included. Invariants 1–4 compare the engine's reconstruction
//! against git's own answer; against a fake they would compare the fake with
//! the fake and pass while proving nothing (ADR 0002). Tests use hermetic
//! temporary repositories and real `git`.
//!
//! The four runtime-open abstractions in this crate — `llm::LlmBackend`,
//! `lang::Language`, `artefact::symbols::SymbolSource` (ADR 0023) and
//! `forge::Forge` (ADR 0029) — are deliberately NOT here. They are `dyn`
//! because config, a plugin registry or the request's host picks them at run
//! time; nothing in this module is chosen at run time.
//!
//! There is no `trait Git: ObjectReader + …` convenience supertrait, and there
//! must not be: the whole value is that a consumer's bounds name what it
//! actually needs.
