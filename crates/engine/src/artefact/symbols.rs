//! Symbol extraction: the port, and the rule for choosing between readers.
//!
//! **This is a domain use case, not a mechanism.** The graph needs to know what
//! each line defines and references. Whether a regex or a parser answered is
//! not a distinction it can see or act on — those are the same capability at
//! different effort and precision.
//!
//! So the trait lives here, beside its only consumer ([`super::graph`]), and
//! the readers live in an adapter crate that depends on this one. The arrow
//! never points the other way (ADR 0020).
//!
//! `dyn` is correct here, and for the reason `CLAUDE.md` allows it: which
//! reader answers is chosen at RUN time, per file. A Rust file picks a reader
//! with a tuned query, a Java file one with generic rules, a shell script the
//! crude one. `lang::LanguageRegistry` already selects this way.

/// How far a name reaches, and therefore what it may be compared against.

/// file boundary. A `File` name reaches only its own file — a `const` inside a
/// function body, a parameter, an import binding — and an edge on it may only
/// join classes in that same file.
///
/// The distinction is the whole guard. ADR 0023 counted only global names
/// because `mod template;` and `fn from` became globally unique symbols that
/// every file mentioning the word then linked to: six such words made 64% of
/// one range's edges. A name confined to its file cannot do that, however
/// common it is — the worst it can cost is an ordering inside one file.
