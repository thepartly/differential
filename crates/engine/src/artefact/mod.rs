//! What the model is given (ADR 0022).
//!
//! The grouping stage used to hand the model a fixed string: one block per
//! shape class, eight lines of diff from the exemplar, six basenames. So a
//! class of nine hunks was rated `skim` — "read one, trust the rest" — on the
//! evidence of one hunk, and the prompt had a character cap that silently
//! truncated large changes.
//!
//! Now the engine writes the pre-group document to a file and the model
//! **fetches** the whole class table from it in one call. Its job is unchanged:
//! it merges class ids, labels and rates, never touching hunks (ADR 0001). What
//! changed is the context it has to do that job with.
//!
//! Every answer here comes from the document. A hunk entry records where a hunk
//! is, never what it says, and the text is `git diff`'s job — so nothing in
//! this module reaches a repository.
//!
//! This module owns all of it — building the class graph ([`graph`]), and
//! answering the one question behind `dfr agent`. It returns data; rendering it
//! as text is `crates/cli`'s job, the same as for every other consumer.

/// than every class that happens to be entirely generated. The noise tier still
/// folds rather than hides: `git diff` reaches any path at all.
