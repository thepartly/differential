//! Configuration, split by ownership (ADR 0012, amended by ADR 0018-era split):
//!
//! - **Repo-level** `.differential.toml` at the target repo's root —
//!   classification hints only. Shared by everyone reviewing the repo.
//! - **User-level** `~/.config/differential/config.toml` (XDG) — `[grouping]`:
//!   which agent CLI to run and its timeout, and `[review]`: which palette the
//!   reviewer wears, how much context it shows around a hunk, and which diff
//!   layout it opens in. All per-user choices, not properties of the repo, so
//!   none of them lives in it.
//!
//! HARD RULE (ADR 0012): config tunes classification hints and tool behaviour.
//! It can never remove a file or hunk from enumeration — enumeration runs before
//! and independently of anything in this module, and nothing here is consulted
//! by the parser or the invariants.
