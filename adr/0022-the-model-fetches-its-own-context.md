# 0022 — The model fetches its own context

Status: accepted. Supersedes [0010](0010-llm-invocation-tools-denied.md).
Extended by [0033](0033-what-makes-an-agent-supportable.md), which adds four more
agents and corrects one claim below: the allowlist did not bind. `--allowed-tools`
adds permissions rather than capping them, so a user's own `defaultMode` outranked it
and "nothing here can write" was false wherever that setting was not `default`.
`--permission-mode default` is now in the argv.

## Context

The grouping stage handed the model one fixed string. Per shape class it carried a header,
up to four removed and four added lines from the **exemplar hunk only**, and up to six
basenames — the whole payload capped at 90,000 characters.

Three things followed from that, and the first is a correctness problem.

1. **The model could not check the claim it makes.** Rating a class `skim` asserts that
   every hunk in it is the same edit, and "read one exemplar, trust the rest" is the whole
   saving (ADR 0006). It had seen one hunk of nine. Nothing else checks within-class
   equivalence either: invariants 1–4 guarantee coverage, not equivalence
   (`spec/invariants.md`).
2. **It merged blind to structure.** The payload carried no dependency information, so it
   could not know that putting a class which defines a trait in the same group as a class
   which consumes another group leaves no valid reading order.
3. **It truncated.** At roughly 400 to 900 characters per class, a change with two hundred
   classes straddles the cap. Classes past it became audit-missing and were back-filled
   into a must-read group — safe, but the opposite of the tool's purpose.

The dependency graph had a second, separate problem. `ordering.rs` built it from **groups**,
unioning every symbol in a group before computing one edge. So a symbol two classes defined
produced an edge only when the model happened to merge those two classes, and contracting
the finer graph onto groups manufactured cycles the change did not contain.

## Decision

**The engine writes what it knows; the model reads what it needs.**

- The pre-group document — `PlanDocument` with `groups: null` — is written to
  `<git-common-dir>/differential/cache/document/<key>.json`, under the grouping cache's own
  key. One grouping, one document.
- The prompt carries instructions, that path, the `dfr agent` command, and the class id
  list. Nothing else. The 90,000-character cap is gone, and with it the truncation
  back-fill.
- **`dfr agent` is one command with one answer**: every class the model may group, in full —
  id, hunk count, file count, disposition, exemplar location, then every member hunk with its
  file and line range, then every file, with `defines:`, `uses:` and `used by:` lines. So the model can look at a non-exemplar member before rating a class, which is the
  thing the old fixed payload could not do.
- **Diff text comes from `git diff`, not from the engine.** `dfr agent` says where every hunk
  is; `git diff <base> <head> -- <path>` says what it holds. The prompt spells that command
  out with the range already in it, because the reader is an agent with a terminal and a
  command it can run beats an instruction it has to assemble.
- **The agent runs in the repository root.** Those paths are relative to it, and git resolves
  a bare pathspec against the current directory. Inheriting the caller's cwd made every
  `git diff` match nothing whenever `dfr` ran from a subdirectory — silently, because
  matching nothing is an empty diff and exit 0. That is the same failure the fetch executable
  has (see the last consequence), reached a different way.
- **One call, because slicing it bought nothing.** A call is a round trip through a model
  turn, and the work behind one is negligible beside it: `dfr agent` answers in under a tenth
  of a second on a 283-hunk range in a debug build. Measured on a 196-class change: one id
  per call made 176 fetches, batching brought it to 28, reaching for the whole change at once
  brought it to 5 — and the whole answer is 72KB, beside the 322KB of diff the model reads
  anyway. Four commands to slice 72KB cost three extra model turns and saved nothing worth
  having.
- **The prompt asks the model to read less.** That is the only lever left, and the
  measurement below is why. It says: read what decides a label and then stop; judge a file
  by its path before opening it, because config, SQL, schema and documentation changes must
  all be *grouped* but rarely need to be *read*; and check a multi-hunk class rather than
  walking every class in turn.
- **Generated content is left out, matching what the prompt's id list offers** (ADR 0006).
  Handing the model a lockfile would be bytes it must read and a class id the audit would
  then reject as a hallucination. `plan::class_is_generated` is the single definition both
  sides use. The noise tier still folds rather than hides: `git diff` reaches any path at
  all, which is what removed the need for a by-name query here.
- **No generated path reaches the model at all.** `generated` joins the shape-class key, so
  a class is wholly generated or wholly not and none of the offered ones contains a lockfile
  hunk. `git diff` honours no tier and will show one to anyone who asks, so the prompt says
  not to ask.
- **The dependency graph moves to `artefact::graph`, built from classes before the model
  runs.** It lands on `ClassEntry.defines` and `ClassEntry.depends_on`; the ordering stage
  contracts it onto groups. Every edge carries the symbols that produced it.
- The default backend gains a read-only allowlist (which ADR 0033 later found needed
  `--permission-mode default` beside it to bind at all):
  `Bash(dfr agent:*),Bash(git diff:*),Read,Grep,Glob,Bash(git log:*),Bash(git show:*)`.
  **`git diff` is advertised; the rest are not.** `git diff` is named in the prompt because
  it is the only way to see what a hunk says, and a tool the model must use and is not told
  about is a tool it will not use. It costs an invitation to read the whole repository and a
  route around the folded generated content; the prompt's instruction to read selectively
  and the class key that keeps generated hunks out of every offered class are what pay for
  it. `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `git log` and
  `git show` stay unadvertised: a model that needs the code around a hunk can go and read it,
  but it is not sent looking.
- **`schema_version` is 3.** `Group.depends_on` becomes a list of `Edge { on, via, cycle }`,
  and `Group` gains `pivot`.

The model's job is unchanged. It merges class ids, labels and rates, and it never touches
hunks (ADR 0001). Only its context changed.

This decision was reached in two passes, and the record is the second one. The first shipped
five queries — `classes`, `class`, `diff`, `file`, `defines` — where `diff` re-enumerated the
range and paged its replies at 256KB. Measuring it settled that round trips were never the
cost, which left reading as the only lever and made an engine-owned diff query the wrong
place to pull it. `git diff` took its place, and the four remaining queries then turned out
to be slicing 72KB into pieces at a model turn each, so they became one.

- **The agent is chosen by name, not by argv.** `[grouping].agent` takes `claude-code`; it
  used to take a command line. The stage hands its agent a tool allowlist, a fetch command
  and a prompt written for what that agent can do, and an arbitrary argv got the prompt and
  none of the rest — a knob that looked like it worked. It also gives a reviewer waiting on
  the call something to read: `LlmBackend::name` is now a product name, and the argv, four
  times the width of the line it had, moved to where it is the answer — the text of a spawn
  failure.

## Why ADR 0010 is superseded, not contradicted

ADR 0010 denied tools because every observed hard failure was the model CLI exiting 1 with
`stop_reason: "tool_use"`. `--allowed-tools ""` sends **no tool definitions**, so the model
cannot emit a tool-use block and cannot fail that way. That was a cure, not a diagnosis: the
failure is a model asking for a tool the harness will not run. A correct allowlist is the
other cure — it asks, and the answer is yes.

`LlmBackend` does not change. It is still `complete(prompt) -> String`; tools run inside the
CLI this spawns. Two failure modes replace the old one, and both are the caller's to see:
the 1200-second deadline, and prose instead of JSON after a long agentic run.

## The mechanism computes dependencies; the model never states them

The model can resolve a symbol better than a regex. It is still not asked to.

Dependency is computable, so it is deterministic, exhaustive over the whole change, and
free. A model asked for edges on top of an already large task would sample rather than
cover, and nothing could check what it returned. The graph is a fact about the diff; the
grouping is a judgement about the diff. Keeping them apart is what lets a cached grouping be
re-ordered on every load without another model call.

## Consequences

- **`depends_on` loses the edges grouping used to create.** A symbol two classes define now
  has no unique definer and produces no edge, where before an edge survived if the model
  merged both defining classes. That is the right loss: what depends on what cannot turn on
  how a label was drawn. A precise `Language` (ADR 0015) would resolve the ambiguity rather
  than drop it.
- **Classes inside a group are now ordered.** The old `def_gi != gi` guard discarded every
  intra-group edge; those edges are the only thing that can order a group's members, so
  `class_ids` is sorted foundation-first.
- **A cycle now says why it exists.** `Edge.cycle` is `artefact` when the class graph is
  acyclic — the deadlock came from contracting classes into groups — and `mutual` when the
  classes deadlock too. On an artefact cycle the class order decides which group is emitted,
  instead of group size.
- **Nothing splits a group.** `pivot` records where a group stops being a foundation and
  starts being a consumer, and stops there. The merge is the model's judgement (ADR 0001),
  the graph that would undo it is heuristic (ADR 0015), and ADR 0007's tolerance — a wrong
  edge only misorders — does not extend to a wrong cut, which would break a coherent group
  and mislabel both halves. The impossibility is information the reviewer wants, not a
  problem to hide behind two rows.
- **`PROMPT_VERSION` is 6 and the backend's identity changed**, so every cached grouping in
  every checkout is invalidated once. Both feed the cache key, so this is automatic, not a
  migration.
- **The cache key hashes the backend's identity, never its display name.** The default
  argv names the executable the prompt tells the model to fetch with, which on an installed
  binary is an absolute path. Where a binary lives determines nothing about a grouping, so
  `LlmBackend::identity` stands a placeholder in its place. Hashing the name instead would
  have made a debug build, a release build and two checkouts of one commit each re-run a
  four-hundred-second call over an identical class partition, and would have defeated the
  worktree-shared cache `plan::grouping_cache_dir` exists to provide (ADR 0009). The
  allowlist itself stays in the key: it shapes what the model can see.
- **A hole the cache key cannot close.** The key covers the prompt version, the backend
  name, the language fingerprint and the class content digests (ADR 0009). A model reading
  `git log` reads history no key can capture, so two clones with different history can group
  differently under one key. That is the price of reaching the *reason* a change was made,
  and no key design fixes it.
- **`dfr agent` never runs the pipeline, never calls a model and never opens a repository.**
  Every answer comes from the document, so a grouping run cannot recurse into itself. It
  takes no `--repo`, because it has nothing to ask git.
- An empty change prints a plain sentence and exits 0. To an agent a blank reply, or a
  non-zero exit, reads as "the tool is broken" and stops it asking.
- **Grouping is now minutes, not seconds, and round trips are not why.** Measured on the
  validation corpus: 176 fetch calls, then 28, then 15, then 5 — and the wall clock went
  450s, 391s, 401s. Round trips fell thirty-five-fold and the time did not move, because
  at roughly 0.9s a call they were never more than about 13 seconds of it. The rest is the
  model reading 322KB of diff and reasoning about 196 classes. Batching removes waste; it
  does not move that floor. The only lever on it is asking the model to read less, and what
  it does not read is what it cannot label from — so the prompt asks for selective reading
  rather than for less reading. The grouping cache means the cost is once per change, not
  once per run.
- **The artefact-against-mutual verdict did not discriminate on the validation corpus.**
  Every one of 45 broken edges came back `mutual`: the class graph was cyclic wherever the
  group graph was. On 196 classes and 290 edges at roughly 30% precision, spurious edges
  make a tangle at every granularity, so the finer graph has nothing cleaner to say. The
  distinction is honest and cheap to compute, and it should start firing when extraction
  gets better — that is what makes precision worth raising, not a reason to drop it.
- **A fetch command that does not work is expensive, and silently so.** The model does not
  give up on a failing tool; it retries and works around it, and only then falls back to the
  class ids. So the executable the prompt names must be one that has `agent`.
  `std::env::current_exe()` is right for the shipped binary and wrong for anything else —
  the dev example resolves its sibling `dfr` and refuses to run without it. The tool
  allowlist is derived from the same string, so the two cannot disagree about it.
