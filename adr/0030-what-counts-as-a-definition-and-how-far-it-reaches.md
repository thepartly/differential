# 0030 — What counts as a definition, and how far it reaches

Status: accepted

Extends [ADR 0023](0023-symbol-extraction-is-a-domain-port.md), which stands.

## Context

A reviewer met this range: one hunk introduces
`const label = lookUpName() ?? fallbackName;` inside a React component, and three later
hunks in the same file render it. The reading plan put the
declaration in one group and the three uses in another, and said **nothing** connected them.
The grouping model, which reads the class graph, wrote "defines the new value every display
site below consumes" in prose — while the graph it had been handed said the class defined
nothing at all.

Three causes, and only the second is a decision:

1. **TypeScript's file-scope value declarations were missing from its query.** No
   `lexical_declaration` pattern, not even under `program`. Rust captures
   `(source_file (const_item …))`, Go `(source_file (const_declaration …))`, Kotlin
   `(source_file (property_declaration …))`. So `export const Panel = () => {}` — the
   dominant declaration form in a TypeScript codebase — defined nothing.
2. **The binding is declared inside a function.** ADR 0023's rule, "a definition is
   a file-scope name others can use", excludes it on purpose.
3. **A bare identifier read is not a reference.** The query captured `@call` and `@type`
   only, and `{label}` is neither. Nor is `<Child …/>`: in the TSX grammar
   a JSX element's name is `identifier`, never `type_identifier`, so **rendering a component
   drew no edge at all** — the main consumption relation in a React codebase was invisible.

Measured on a TypeScript corpus of five ranges: **four produced zero edges and zero
definitions**. The fifth produced thirteen, every one of them from an `interface` or `type`
name. The graph was a *type* graph.

Two more, found the same way on a Rust range once the above was in hand:

4. **An inherent `impl` method was never a definition.** A reviewer met a change that adds
   `pub async fn load_batch` to `impl Service` and calls it from another crate, and the
   plan drew no edge. Only `function_item` directly under `source_file` was a definition. In
   the same range, `pub(crate) async fn load_config` at module top level *did* draw its
   edge — the only difference between them was the `impl` block.
5. **A function named without being called was not a reference.** `.route(api::widgets::handler, …)`
   hands a function over; the query captured a `scoped_identifier` only in **callee**
   position, so registration tables — routers, dispatch maps, anything built by naming
   functions — drew nothing. The definition was there and global; the use side never
   asked for it.

## Decision

**A symbol carries a scope, and a file-local name may only draw an edge between classes in
the same file.**

```rust
pub enum Scope { Global, File }
pub struct Symbol { pub name: Vec<u8>, pub scope: Scope }
```

`artefact::graph` keys a global name by the name alone and a file-local name by
`(file, name)`. Everything else is unchanged — including the single-definer rule, which now
judges ambiguity per file: two files each declaring `label` are not a clash, and one file
declaring it twice still is.

**This does not reopen what ADR 0023 closed.** That ADR's failure was `mod template;` and
`fn from` becoming *globally* unique symbols that every file mentioning the word then linked
to — six words, 64% of one range's edges. A file-local name cannot do that however common it
is. It is compared only against its own file's answers, so the worst a wrong one costs is an
ordering inside one file, and the candidate set it competes in is small enough that the
single-definer rule usually resolves it.

Three consequences for the readers:

- **Tuned queries gain `@local_def` and `@local_ref`.** The locals are exactly the
  declarations the file-scope rule deliberately drops — a binding inside a function, a
  parameter, an import, a method — and `(identifier) @local_ref` is everything that might be
  reading one.
- **TypeScript gains its exported file-scope value declarations, and TSX its JSX names.**
  Both are corrections, not extensions: the first is the convention every other query
  already follows, and the second is a call by another spelling.
- **The field-rule reader calls every other declaration file-local.** It cannot tell which
  of them sits at file scope — a JavaScript `export const Panel = …` looks like any other
  `variable_declarator` from there — so the conservative reading is the honest one. It costs
  cross-file edges those names never drew anyway.

**A type-owned method IS a definition; a trait-owned one is not.** This is the line
ADR 0023 drew in the wrong place, and the corpus says where it belongs. `fn from` in
`impl From<X> for Y` shares its name with every conversion in the tree — that is the
ambiguity that ADR measured, and it stays excluded. `impl Service { fn load_batch }`
shares its name with nothing: it is the one place that name is declared, and callers in
other files reach it by exactly that name. In Rust the two are told apart by a negated
field, `(impl_item !trait …)`; Go's `method_declaration` has a receiver and no trait-impl
case to separate; Python and Kotlin take their class-body methods. Taking *every* `impl`
method instead — trait ones included — was measured too: it bought one more edge and cost a
**three-class cycle**.

**A name reached by path is a reference, called or not.** A new `@ref` capture, sitting
beside `@call` and `@type` and treated identically by the reader. `@call` had come to mean
"consumed", which it does not say, and a value handed to a router is consumed exactly as a
called function is.

**Exported, and only exported — for a type exactly as for a value.** A definition is a
name *others can use*, and in a module system `export` is exactly that predicate. Counting a
bare top-level `const send = vi.fn()` in a test file linked every production file calling
`send` to that test, and closed a two-class cycle with the true edge running the other way —
ADR 0023's own failure, reappearing through the new rule.

The gate has to apply to `class`, `interface`, `type` and `enum` too, which it did not at
first: those were captured anywhere in the file and regardless of `export`. An unexported
`type FormData = …` in an integration test was then the only thing in one change that
"defined" that name, and two files in another language linked to the test because of it.
Removing those two false edges cost nothing else anywhere — every real
interface-name edge in the measured ranges is on an exported declaration.

Unexported, the same name is still read as file-local, so it keeps every edge it can
honestly draw.

## Consequences

Measured over five ranges of a TypeScript corpus. `sccs` is the number that matters: a
topological sort works if and only if every strongly connected component has size one.

| range | language | classes | edges before | edges after | sccs before | sccs after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | TS/TSX | 9 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | TS/TSX | 30 | 13 | 33 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | TS/TSX | 27 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | TS/TSX | 11 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | TS/TSX | 17 | 0 | 6 | 0 | 0 |
| 6 | Rust | 62 | 20 | 21 | 0 | 0 |

Not one new cycle, and the edges that arrived are component composition, util calls,
analytics builders, a service method and a route registration — the structure a reviewer of
those changes actually needs. Ranges 3 and 5 gained edges from the scoping alone: names that
were ambiguous as globals resolve as locals.

**Rust and TypeScript are measured. Go, Python and Kotlin are not**, and they took the same
widening on the argument alone — which is the move ADR 0023 was written against, so it is
recorded here rather than left to be discovered. Two specific risks follow from that:

- **Go and Python spell a qualified name and a field read identically.** `handlers.Listing`
  and `s.Name` are both a `selector_expression`/`attribute`, so `@ref` takes struct field
  and attribute reads as well. The single-definer rule has to absorb them. Rust does not
  have this problem: `scoped_identifier` is a path and nothing else.
- **Python and Kotlin are duck-typed**, so two classes may answer to one method name. Those
  collide and the single-definer rule drops them, which is the safe direction — but it also
  means the method rule buys less there than it does in Rust or Go.

- **The readers' fingerprints all change, which colds every cached grouping** by design
  (`grouping/key.rs`): the class graph is part of what the model reads (ADR 0022).
- **`(identifier) @local_ref` turns a handful of captures per file into one per token**, and
  `is_prose` answers each by climbing to the root. That is the quadratic shape
  `deep_nesting_costs_neither_stack_nor_quadratic_time` exists to catch, and it fired: the
  tuned reader now collects prose token ranges in one linear pass, the way the field-rule
  reader already carried its flags down. `is_prose` survives as the rule's definition and as
  the fallback for a capture that is not a token.
- **A query's version is now pinned to its text by a test.** Six versions moved in this
  change, and a version reaches the cache key — a forgotten bump serves a stale grouping for
  a graph that moved.
- **Rust's `(source_file (const_item …)) @def` does not check `pub`**, so it has the same
  latent shape as the TypeScript rule above. Left alone: it was there before this change,
  Rust constants are conventionally `SCREAMING_CASE` rather than common words, and moving it
  belongs to its own measurement. The new inherent-`impl` rule does not check `pub` either,
  for the same reason and with the same caveat.
- **Every query version moves to `-v3`** on top of the `-v2` this change already made, so a
  checkout that ran an intermediate build re-groups rather than being served a grouping for
  a graph that has since moved.
- **A global symbol still had no language when this was written**, so `FormData` in a Rust
  type position and `FormData` in a TypeScript one were one symbol. The export gate above
  removes the egregious half — a private test alias posing as the definition — but a genuine
  exported name still matched across languages.
  [ADR 0031](0031-a-global-name-is-scoped-to-its-language.md) closes it, and the measurement
  it took is not the one expected here: separating the namespaces *added* edges, because a
  name declared once per language had two definers and the single-definer rule was dropping
  it for both.

## Alternatives rejected

**Scoping the crude reader's references too.** Its "every identifier of four characters or
more" is the loosest thing in the system and the obvious next candidate. But it is the only
reader Ruby, PHP, Swift and Elixir have, and file-scoping it would delete every cross-file
edge those languages draw. That is a precision question with its own corpus measurement, and
bundling it here would make one movement in the numbers impossible to attribute.

(PHP and Swift have since gained queries of their own, along with Zig, so the languages that
argument is about are Ruby, Elixir and the rest of the floor's list. The argument itself is
unchanged: whichever languages the floor is the only reader for, file-scoping it deletes
every cross-file edge they draw.)

**Splitting a group when the graph says it holds both a definition and its use.** The merge
is the model's judgement (ADR 0001) and the graph that would undo it is heuristic. A wrong
edge misorders; a wrong cut breaks a coherent group and mislabels both halves.
