# One split-pane screenshot of the reviewer, for a single palette.
#
# A TEMPLATE, not a runnable tape: `assets/themes.sh` substitutes `__THEME__`
# and runs one copy of this per theme. That is deliberate. Recording all eleven
# in one tape shares a terminal between them, and a shared terminal shares
# scrollback, leftover keystrokes and a shell prompt — `Wait+Screen` matched a
# previous run's reviewer still in the buffer and fired the shot at a bare
# prompt, twice out of eleven. One terminal per screenshot has none of that,
# and the whole run is no slower for it.
#
#   ./assets/themes.sh
#
# $DFR, $FIXTURE, $CFG and $RANGE come from that script.

# Wait on what is on screen, never on a fixed delay: the pipeline is a cache
# hit here but still enumerates, and a sleep long enough to be safe on a slow
# machine is a sleep wasted on every other one.
#
# And wait on a word the REVIEWER draws, not one the splash shares. `reading
# plan` is in the splash too — its grouping stage is called "labelling the
# reading plan" — so that regex matched the first frame and the sleep below
# was doing the waiting. `reviewed` is the plan pane's own footer hint.
Wait+Screen@60s /reviewed/

# A beat after the first paint. `Wait+Screen` returns as soon as the reviewer
# has DRAWN, which is a moment before it is reading keys — a `tab` sent on the
# frame it appeared was dropped, and the arrow keys that followed walked the
# plan instead of the diff.

# Into the diff pane. With the plan focused the file tree floats over the diff,
# and the diff is what a palette is judged on. `enter` rather than `tab`: it
# says move to the diff rather than toggle, so it cannot land back on the plan.
#
# The layout needs no keypress: split is what a review opens in.
