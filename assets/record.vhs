# Run the last one FROM THE assets DIRECTORY. `Output` and `Screenshot` below
# are relative paths, and vhs resolves them against the process directory, not
# the tape's.
#
# The first two are not optional either. The tape records the `dfr` it finds on
# PATH, and an installed one is whatever was last released — this video is a
# feature demo, so it has to be this tree.
#
# The third warms the grouping cache, and it warms it BEFORE vhs starts. On a
# miss that is a live agent call of a minute or more. Inside the tape it cannot
# be waited on: `Wait+Screen` starts its clock when vhs types, not when the
# shell finishes, so a cold cache expires the wait below rather than delaying
# it. Outside, a forgotten warm is a loud vhs timeout instead of a wrong video.
#
# The range is fixed on purpose. This tape used to type a bare `dfr review`
# and walk the commit picker, so every recording was a different diff and no
# two runs could be compared. `ecc9400..cfea95f` is 11 commits and 79 files,
# and its plan has all three tiers in it: eight focus groups, six skim, one
# folded noise group. Every beat below has real material to land on.
#
# Needs `vim` for the last beat.

# Every run starts from the same screen. The reviewer records its cursor, its
# layout and its reviewed marks per review, so without this the recording
# resumes wherever the last one stopped. Delete ONLY the sessions for this
# range: this is a real repository with real reviews in it, and the blanket
# `rm -rf .../reviews` that assets/themes.sh uses is safe only there, on a
# throwaway fixture.
#
# Ask git where that directory is; do not spell `.git` out. `dfr` resolves it
# with `rev-parse --git-common-dir` (crates/engine/src/gitio.rs), and in a
# worktree `.git` is a FILE — the state lives in the bare parent. A hard-coded
# `.git/differential` matches nothing there, deletes nothing, and the run
# resumes wherever the last one stopped, silently. The `cd` above is what lets
# the relative `.git` a plain clone answers with still resolve.
#
# The grouping cache is a SIBLING of reviews/ and is deliberately kept, so the
# splash below is a cache hit rather than a live agent call. The `dfr findings`
# in the header is what fills it. Do not reach for `dfr clean`: it deletes the
# cache and leaves the sessions, which is the wrong way round.

# Wait on a word the REVIEWER draws and the splash cannot. This used to read
# `/reading plan/`, which the splash prints too: its grouping stage is called
# "labelling the reading plan", and it says so both before that stage starts
# and after it ticks (crates/tui/src/splash.rs). So the wait returned on the
# first frame and the `Sleep 1s` below was carrying the whole tape into the
# reviewer. `reviewed` is the plan pane's own footer hint (app/help.rs).

# One press, not two. `z` steps a line's names in column order and closes past
